% With Software As a Service,<br/> Is Only the Network Luddite Free?

# In The Beginning ...

<img align=right src="pdp-10.jpg" />

+ There was a computer.

+ There were terminals.

+ There were users.

+ ... and the users had freedom.

# Ye Ol' Four Freedoms

+ to use.

+ to learn and modify for yourself.

+ to copy and share.

+ to modify and share modified versions.

# &hellip; Then Freedom Eluded Us

+ They built licensing walls.

+ By separating the software from the computer.

+ Who Invented Licensing?

# Who Invented Licensing?
<br/>
Some think he did:

<p>Hai Hobbyists!  Softwearz gived free-domes, but I ated them.</p>

<br clear="all"/>

+ Gates convinces IBM to license rather then acquire DOS.

# RMS

+ Job at MIT's AI lab in late 1970s and early 1980s.

+ Programming their PDP-10!

+ In the Golden Age.

# MIT AI Lab: The Golden Age

<img src="pdp-10-2.jpg" align="right"  />

 - academic computing.
 - software sharing.
 - no licenses!

MIT changed.

# MIT AI Lab

<cite>patents == $$$</cite>

# MIT AI Lab

<cite>spin-offs == $$$</cite>

# GNU

<img src="gnu-hacker.jpg" align="right"/>

+ Changes the world.

+ For the user of individual computers.

+ No reason now not to have freedom on your own machine.

# Internet changes little (to start)

+ Client/Server computing.

+ Freedom implications are basically the same.

+ Example: The Email System.

# Email: The MTA

+ Yours has freedom: (postfix, exim, sendmail).

+ Plenty of proprietary ones: (exchange).

+ RFCs define interoperability.

+ We reverse-engineer RFC-less protocols: (OpenChange).

# Email: The MUA

+ Yours has freedom: (Thunderbird, mutt, Gnus)

+ Plenty of proprietary ones: (outlook)

# The Great Fear: SaaS

+ SaaS: Software as a Service

+ True &ldquo;SaaS&rdquo; would end software freedom.

+ Imagine: GCC as an network service.

+ SaaS == your private computing done elsewhere.

+ Copyeft proponents all feared this threat.

+ Is not widspread: but needs constant vigilance:

+ Unicode Character 'CLOUD' (U+2601)
+ Given what this looks like &hellip;
     + &hellip; Unicode committee was omniscient.

# Cloud Computing: What changed?

+ The Browser as application delivery platform.

+ AJAX.

+ Whose computing is done where?

+ Could Computing: more complicated than SaaS.

+ Interesting applications are collaboration.

# Email becomes Gmail

+ "The experience"

+ Effectively: Thin Client.

+ Mixes Up Free again: Price vs. Freedom.

+ RFCs no longer enough.

+ We're back to proprietary "lock-in".

+ Users like it for collaboration aspects.

<p>Even *Worse* Than Proprietary Apps and OS'es</p>

# What's The Challenge?

+ Not merely a question of code and licensing.
      + Although that's part of it (more later).

+ A question of community source+data control.

+ Power to transport: applications, data, human connections.

+ Autonomy: of code, of data, of community.

# How Do We Start?

<img src="cloud-bad-with-bird-on-left.jpg" align="right"/>

+ Infrastructure that respects freedom.

+ Empower the user: give them **all** the code.

# Can't Stop There

+ User communities need ability to transplant.

+ Reclaim your data; relocate your community.

+ Truly distributed data.

+ This is  **tough**  programming.

# Projects to Look At

+ status.net identi.ca (laconi.ca).
     + DTRT in this regard for Microblogging
     + Follow me there: 'bkuhn'

+ Jesse Vincent's Prophet, CouchDB, and other truly decentralized data stores.

+ Yourselves.
    + make it even easier for developers to respect freedom.

# License To Look At

+ GPL is the BSD of Network Service.

+ Affero GPL.

+ Extends copyleft to network service world.

+ Handles the code side well.

# Techniques to Look At

+ Deployed applications auto-give users source.

+ Data is downloadable in community-chunks.

# "Future" of the Cloud

<img width=433 height=388 src="cloud-disappear.jpg" align="right"/>

+ Disjoint but Integrated.

+ Portable and Autonomous.

+ Developers decide next direction.

+ Ask **the** question in Cloud projects:
      + Are we respecting the users' freedom and autonomy?

+ The data is theirs; we are *their* custodians.
