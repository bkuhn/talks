# Upgrades

<img width="450" height="338" src="cybermen_on_bbc.jpg" align="right"  />

+ No citizen *wants* a mandatory upgrade.
+ An upgrade is a trade-off.
    - We do it when the new features outweigh the pain.
    - ... or when we are sick of the bugs.

# License are Legal Code

+ Licenses aren't that different from code.
    - We find bugs; we fix them.
    - We see useful places for features; we add them.
+ The tough part is; *legal* code has so much ''weight''.
+ Copyright is a powerful and frightening tool (weapon?).

# But what bugs does GPLv2 have?

<img width="500" height="184" src="hopper-bug-crop.jpg" align="right"  />

+ No Internet distribution.
    - (yes, really!)
+ Na&iuml;ve about patents.
+ USA-centric.
+ Overly nasty termination.
+ Exceptions are clunky.
+ Ignores embedded software.
+ No web services clause.

# v2: Internet Distribution
+ v2 talks about software "medium".
+ This doesn't mean the network.
+ Technically, binaries online requires:
     - source on CD!
+ Fortunately, no one "reads it" as prohibiting network distribution.
+ But they can, and do sometimes&hellip;
    - &hellip; just to annoy people.


# v3: Internet Distribution
+ &sect; 6(b) and 6(d) explicitly discuss network distribution.
+ 6(d): side-by-side permitted.
+ 6(b): no sneaky "online binaries, written offers".
+ Two bugs closed!      

# Why Worry About Patents?

+ Most companies with patents aggressively enforce them.
     - even if they pretend they don't.

+ Industry-wide initiatives merely want "patent reform" or "operating system safety only".

+ See Stallman's essay: Patent Reform is Not Enough.

+ Patents squelch commercial side of software freedom. 

# v2 on Patents

+ The "magical" &sect; 7.
+ Patent license is only implicit.
+ Handles only "conditions imposed on" distributor.
     - such as a patent judgement.
+ Ignores patent threats and even some contradictory licenses.

# v3 on Patents

+ Discussed explicitly (&sect; 11)!
+ Full contributor patent licensing.
+ "Knowing reliance" on patent licenses:
     - requires various actions by distributor.
+ Has (now) famous "Anti-Novell/Microsoft deal clause".

# v2: USA-Centric

<img width="450" height="338" src="american-dad.jpg" align="right"  />

+ copying, modifying, and distributing
    - magic words of USA copyright
+ Ignores that other terminology is used elsewhere.

# v3: Worldwide Ready

<img width="450" height="365" src="polyconic-projection.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Propagate.
+ Convey.
+ Both defined in ways that work in all places we know.

# v2: Termination

<img width="450" height="250" src="daleks.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Violate Once, and the Code Gets It!
+ If you violate for ten seconds:
    - you lose your right to distribute.
    - Forever.
+ Go beg the copyright holder.

# v3: Termination (lite!)
+ Self-forgiveness for the Repentant.
+ If you stop and copyright holder never complained:
    - you can start conveying again immediately.
    - all is forgiven in 60 days.
+ You also get 30 days after first complaint from copyright holder.

# Compatibility

+ Compatibility: permission to combine two works under different licenses.
+ Apache-2.0 is a great license &hellip;
    - &hellip; but it contradicts GPLv2.
+ Or, GPLv2 contradicts *it*, depending on your point of view.
+ v3 works hard to approach universal compatibility with permissive licenses.

# Exceptions
+ Pretty simple:
+ v2 has no structure for exceptions.
    - We all did them anyway.
    - Boy, they were clunky.
+ v3 has an exception framework.
    - Exceptions are read as text of license.
    - Allows actual license hacking!
    - If we screw up, v3 sets it aside.

# Embedded Software and DRM

+ The center of v3 controversy.
+ Controversy was about early draft.
+ Final draft is, frankly, watered down.

# v3 and DRM

<img width="400" height="300" src="i-void-warranties-in-action.jpg" align="right"  />

+ *Only* Consumer products.
+ Only says:
     - vendor must tell you how to jailbreak
+ Your warranty is voided.
+ You can be booted off network.
+ Google's distribution of HTC Dream and Nexus One is v3 compliant!

# Mobile Exception

+ It's possible to have an exception for certain mobile uses.

+ I don't recommend it.

+ But if forced to chose between GPLv3+some_exception & GPLv2, I pick the former.

# LGPLv3

+ No reason not to switch.

+ GPLv2 incompatible fixable with: (GPLv2|LGPLv3-or-later)

+ Might be a "soft" way to begin GPLv3 adoption.

# AGPLv3
+ Adds a network service clause.
+ Not part of v3 proper: separate license.
+ This slide could be a whole talk.
+ Basic premise:
     - when someone can legitimately use.
     - you've gotta give them source.
