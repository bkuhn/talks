% Saturday 22 February 2014

# Thanks to SCALE

+ This is one of the best conferences in the Open Source and Free Software community.

+ Because it's community-run and organized by a non-profit.

+ For-profit corporate control is not an issue here.

+ That means a lot to me as a non-profit career administrator &amp; policy wonk.

+ Also, thanks to SCALE for covering my travel expenses this year.

# Governance / Licensing First

+ I always hate sitting through talks waiting to hear what the license is.

+ Conservancy's NPO Accounting Project will:
     + Be multi-copyright held (NO CLA!) &hellip;
     + &hellip; even Conservancy is letting contractors keep copyright.
     + new code licensed under Affero GPL.
     + any upstreamable code: use license of upstream project &hellip;
     + &hellip; specifically Ledger-CLI is 3-Clause-BSD.

+ All development done in public:
     + Max time btw. authorship &amp; publish is a day or two.
     + But an hour or two is ideal.
     + Public mailing list and IRC channel.

# A Brief History of Accounting Software

+ Accounting software systems have existed since 1960s.

+ Imagine how many times our society as reinvented this wheel.

+ People are *still* getting hired to write COBOL &hellip;
     + &hellip; mostly for accounting/financial systems.

# &amp; In Open Source and Free Software?

+ Phase 0 of our project: evaluate known FLOSS accounting software.

+ Results: http://npoacct.sfconservancy.org/ExistingProjects/
     + Nearly 20 projects.
     + Every single one of them *reinvents the double-entry wheel*.
     + And often not very well.
     + e.g.: ERPNext: we found two SQL injection attacks in 30 minutes.
     + None of them separate API boundry walls adequately.
