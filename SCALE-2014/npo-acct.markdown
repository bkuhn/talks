# Thanks to SCALE

+ This is one of the best conferences in the Open Source and Free Software community.

+ Because it's community-run and organized by a non-profit.

+ For-profit corporate control is not an issue here.

+ That means a lot to me as a non-profit career administrator &amp; policy wonk.

+ Also, thanks to SCALE for covering my travel expenses this year.
