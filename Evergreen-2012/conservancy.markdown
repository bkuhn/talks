# In The Beginning ...

<img align=right src="pdp-10.jpg" />

+ There was a computer.

+ There were terminals.

+ There were users.

+ ... and the users had freedom.

# Ye Ol' Four Freedoms

+ to use.

+ to learn and modify for yourself.

+ to copy and share.

+ to modify and share modified versions.

# &hellip; Then Freedom Eluded Us

<img align=right src="berlin-wall-build.jpg" />

+ They built licensing walls.

+ By separating the software from the computer.

+ Who Invented Licensing?

# Who Invented Licensing?
<br/>
Some think he did:
<br/>
<img src="bill-gates-arrest.jpg" align="left"  />
<p>As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. &hellip; [If] software is something to share &hellip; You prevent good software from being written.</p>

<br clear="all"/>

+ Gates convinces IBM to license rather than acquire DOS.

# RMS

<img align=right src="rms-book-cover.jpg"  />

+ Job at MIT's AI lab in late 1970s and early 1980s.

+ Programming their PDP-10!

+ In the Golden Age.

# MIT AI Lab: The Golden Age

<img src="pdp-10-2.jpg" align="right"  />

 - academic computing.
 - software sharing.
 - no licenses!

# GNU Project

<img src="gnu-head.jpg" align="right" />

+ RMS founds GNU project.

+ Founded on idealism.

+ Recruited volunteers.

+ Paid non-profit staff.

+ Those projects remain community-oriented &hellip;

+ &hellip; but most are software-developer-oriented.

# Proprietary Software Grows

+ By the mid 1990s, proprietary software was the default.

+ Programmers who didn't want to use proprietary software had to write their own.

+ Focus on developer tools (because they needed that first).

+ But for users &hellip; ?

# Proprietary Harms Users Too

+ Meanwhile, users are harmed too.

+ A (recent-ish) example from libraries community.
     + In 2009, Queens library rejects Sirsi's system &amp; seeks to buy an ILS from Horizon.
     + Srisi acquires Horizon to block this; discontinues Horizon's product.
     + Settled for undisclosed terms.
     + This should not happen: users should control their own software.

# Free Software Helps?

+ But, how does Free Software prevent this?

# Copy, Right?

+ Most software uses a contract EULA.

+ This doesn't work for Free Software &hellip;
     + &hellip; which needs worldwide distribution.

+ Copyright, which governs software anyway, can do this.

# Free Software Copyright License

+ Roughly two different types of Free Sofware licenses:
    + permissive vs. copyleft
    + both **want** software freedom.

+ Permissive licensing:
    + no legal requirement to share improvements.
    + authors usually still want it.
    + use social pressure.

+ Copyleft.
     + prevents proprietarization by power of copyright.
     + share and share alike.
     + failure to do so is copyright infringement.
     + Evergreen's license is a copyleft license, GPL.

# The Danger of Our Success

+ Open Source is a corporate *fad* now.
    + companies give lip service to &ldquo;community&rdquo;.

+ Companies employ developers &hellip;
     - &hellip; maybe to work on Free Software (which is great!).
     - &hellip; but companies control employee's time in their interest.

# Where Things Are Heading

+ FLOSS slowly goes toward for-profit corporate interest.

+ Or, it's purely thrown over the wall.
    - At corporate whim

+ Project decisions are made by companies.

# Software Freedom Governance?

+ Corporate sponsorship are common.

+ But for-profit control of projects can be dangerous.

# Danger of For-Profits

+ For-profits act in interest in shareholders.

+ Those who care most about software are usually *not* shareholders.

+ Interests only align sometimes with community.

# Non-Profits are Different

+ USA 501(c)(3) non-profits act in interest of the public good.

+ Software freedom is best when in public good.

+ Non-profit orgs (NPOs) are best place for software freedom.

# What Can USA NPOs Do?

+ Hold assets for the project, like trademarks:
    + Avoid the <a href="http://library-matters.blogspot.co.nz/search/label/trademark">problem that occurred with Koha's trademark</a>.

+ Collect donations for the project.
    + Distribute that money to advance project (and public good).

+ Help leadership with non-technical decisions.

+ Neutral ground when for-profit corporations sponsor.
    + Negotiate &ldquo;peace treaties&rdquo; with companies.
    + Conservancy recently did so: DIG licensing issue.

# Funding Through Conservancy 

+ Travel to conferences.

+ Handling Google SoC and other philanthropy programs.

+ Conference invoicing and contracts (like this one).

+ Stipends and paid development contracts for developers.

+ Fiscal oversight.

# Fiscal Oversight

+ Part of my job is to preemptively prevent this:

# What You Won't Find Here:

There weren't any of these in your conference bag:

***

# What You Won't Find Here:

There won't be a mind reader at the reception Friday:

***

<img src="gsa-mind-reader.png" align="center" />

# Fiscal Oversight

+ Things are never egregious like that.

+ More about watching IRS non-profit rules &amp; ensuring compliance.

# What's Special About Evergreen?

+ Don't tell the other projects &hellip;
    + &hellip; but they'll know when I put these slides online &hellip;
    + &hellip; but Evergreen is very special to Conservancy.

+ Evergreen is the only Conservancy project led primarily by its **users**.

+ This is important for the future 

# Next for Evergreen in Conservancy?

+ SoC 2012.

+ Conservancy hopes to help Evergreen raise more funds.
    + Hope to fund improvements users need via Conservancy.

+ Trademark transfer from Georgia Public Library System.

+ Ensuring compliance with the GPL.
