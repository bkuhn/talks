# Sorry for my Virus

<img src="rhinovirus.jpg" align="right"  />

+ First time I've had a rhinovirus while traveling since 2002.

+ Hearing how bad my throat is shows why I get upset when people call GPL a virus.

# My History

+ Worked my first GPL enforcement case in 1999 (as FSF volunteer).

+ Started working for FSF in 2000 (until 2005).

+ Worked at SFLC from 2005-2010.

+ Now Executive Director of Conservancy.

+ Plurality of my time since 1999 has been spent on GPL enforcement.

# Earliest Copylefted Programs

+ GNU Emacs: AFAIK Emacs' copyleft never been violated.

+ GCC: much more interesting to proprietary software companies.

+ Who was the first GPL violator?

# The NeXT Shall be First

<img src="steve-jobs-next.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Objective-C front end.

<p>In "The NeXT Book" by Bruce Webster, he says: (page 134):</p>
<p>
	Objective C is based on the Gnu C compiler developed by
	Richard Stallman.  Release 0.9 has merged the Objective
	C syntax with the the Gnu C compiler to speed up compilation
	and to produce faster, more efficient code.
</p>


<p>Are they using FSF software in their product? Or is Webster just badly
explaining the situation ...  and Objective C is just preprocessing and
passing C to gcc.</p>

<p>Otherwise Gang, I see a Copyleft violation right?</p>

<p>In response to Steve Simmons' inquiry about an Objective-C
front-end for GCC, NeXT will be making our modifications to
GCC for Objective-C available very soon.</p>

<p>Once GCC-1.36 is released (any day now), I will create a patch
kit which will be announced on this mailing list.  (The modifications
are very small.)</p>

# Thus Begins Jobs GPL hatred.

<img src="steve-jobs-bond.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Apple to this day works hard to ditch GCC.

+ Funds LLVM.

+ Spreads FUD about GPLv3.

# Tar Wars

<img width="274" height="383" align=right src="tar-wars.gif"/>

<p> A long time ago, in a city far far away, the Empires had taken GNU tar
and placed it into proprietary backup solutions.  A small band of freedom
fighters enforced the GPL to liberate users who were opressed by the
proprietary nature of GPL violators.</p>


# Tar Wars

+ Tape backup systems essential in late 1990s.

+ Many companies made forks of GNU Tar, and violated.

+ Sysadmins were good at noticing.

+ All but one came into compliance.

# Courts won't give compliance.

+ Last GNU tar enforcement I ever did (circa mid-2002).

+ Company decided to *remove* tar &amp; rewrite rather than compliance.

+ Let's sue!

+ Lawyers told me court won't grant compliance.

+ You just get money and injuction (they already de-facto gave latter).

# Coalition of the Willing

+ Spring 2003: dozens of reports on WRT54G.

+ Discussions begin with Cisco (who'd bought Linksys just weeks before)

+ Story hits slashdot 2003-06-08

+ FSF puts together group to do enforcement.
     - key members: Erik Andersen (BusyBox) &amp; Harald Welte (Linux)

# Compliance Takes Soooo Long

+ FSF represents the coalition.

+ Broadcom is discovered as upstream.

+ WRT54G source is released (but wireless driver kept proprietary).

+ Broadcom argues FCC prohibits; FSF agrees not to pursue (can't really anyway).

+ WRT54G releases spawns OpenWRT community.

+ Harald is frustrated.

# GPL-violations.org

+ FSF was initially shy about lawsuits.

+ Harald disagreed with FSF strategy (in hindsight, he was right).

+ launches multiple lawsuits in Germany (about 8 between 2005-2008).

+ Quite successful, although has same &ldquo;court will only grant injunction&rdquo; problem.

# GCC Redux, 2003-2005

+ Embedded systems become major part of industry.

+ GCC is best compiler.

+ Many companies start making GCC-based toolchains.

+ Focus of post-WRT54G enforcement at FSF.

# Funding Crisis for Enforcement

+ FSF had hoped to raise funds "certifying compliance".

+ You can't break even on this for less than $10,000/release.

+ No one is willing to pay.

+ Those who'd know enough to buy services think they'll get away with violations anyway.

# Money

+ No one in non-profits is getting rich from this.

+ Who should pay for enforcement: 
     - Compilers or Violators?
     - Individual donors.

+ There must be some deterrent.

+ Non-profit enforcement == accountability.

+ Confidentiality is something violators ask for.

# Enforcement Corruption: MySQL

<img width="274" height="383" align=right src="marten-mickos.jpg"/>

+ Proprietary relicensing (by holding all copyright).

+ GPL enforcement with profit as its goal.

+ MySQL would shake down GPL users to buy proprietary licenses they didn't need.

+ I wish I'd realize how corrupt this is soon.

# Embedded Violations Prevalent

+ Erik Andersen becomes exasperated.

+ Asks for help.

+ Conservancy becomes his enforcement agent (and gets some others &copy; assignment)

+ Conservancy has had > 100 (now > 300) GPL violations queued for action since 2007.

+ Lawsuits become necessary.

+ Focus is to settle: only way to get compliance rather than merely injunction &amp; money.

# The Upstream Problem

<img align=left src="michael-scott.jpg"/>

When I said that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I
don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't
arrest a guy who was just passing drugs from one guy to another.

<p align=right>
 -- Michael Scott, *The Office* 
</p>

# Suppliers Bully OEMs, AFAICT 

+ I'd be the worst cop in the world.

+ No one ever turns &ldquo;states' evidence&rdquo;

+ Me: &ldquo;Please, just tell me on the record your supplier violator&rdquo;

+ Them: &ldquo;We'll work with our upstream to get into compliance.&rdquo;

# Linksys Redux

+ 2003-2004, everything they put out is VxWorks.

+ Circa late 2004, BusyBox/Linux &amp; GNU/Linux slowly becomes the Linksys default again.

+ FSF finally gets fed up and sues.

# C&CS is the Hardest Part.

+ GPL/LGPL is by far the most popular software license.
     - Shown clearly in Google Code Search &amp; SourceForge License Data

+ GPLv2: &ldquo;scripts to control compilation and installation of the executable&rdquo;

+ GPLv3: &ldquo;Install Information&rdquo;

# Today.

<img align=left src="DQWindmill.gif"/>

+ I continue on at BusyBox &amp; Samba enforcement through Conservancy.
     - new reports at least once a week.

+ Matthew Garrett works hard at Android compliance.

+ Poor Brett at FSF is overwhelmed with violation reports.

+ Armijn tries to find time in his schedule to enforce.

+ GPL Violations are everywhere.
