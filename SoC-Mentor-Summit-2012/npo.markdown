# Who Am I?

+ Two official roles:
    - On Board of Directors of Free Software Foundation.
    - President and Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ Many of my views are influenced by these roles.

+ These are still my views, not those of these orgs or others.

# The Rise of the Volunteers

+ Most Free Software is written by volunteers &hellip;
     + &hellip; who are only such from the point of view of the projects.

+ The volunteers are usually paid for by for-profits
     - Red Hat, Google, IBM, etc.

# For-Profit vs. Non-Profit

+ For-profits act in interest in shareholders.

+ 501(c)(3) non-profits act in interest of the public good.

+ Software freedom is best when in public good.

+ Non-profit orgs (NPOs) are best place for software freedom.

+ NPOs can accept for-profit donations, but provide a firewall.

# For-Profit-Employee &ldquo;Volunteers&rdquo;

+ Most code written by for-profit employees.
     + *20% time* is a boon to software freedom.
     + **But** codebases drift in directions of company's needs.

+ Some developers should be *funded* by non-profits,
     - to mitigate dangers of for-profit control.

***

> It's the duty of all Free Software developers to steal as much time as they can from their employers for software freedom.

# What Can NPOs Do?

+ Collect (USA-tax-deductible) donations for a project.
      - both individual and corporate.

+ Distribute that money to advance project (and public good).

+ Make sure project isn't controlled by for-profit interests.

+ Help leadership with non-technical decisions.

# Organization Proliferation

+ Too many NPOs will confuse donors.

+ Each needs board of directors, incorporation, meetings, IRS filings.

+ Hackers end up doing work they hate.

+ Less Free Software gets written.

+ Rob will talk about how this is not so bad.

# Aggregating Under Umbrella

+ Sometimes called a &ldquo;fiscal sponsor&rdquo;
    + it doesn't mean they give you money &hellip;
    + &hellip; but rather handle assets for you.

+ Many projects get same benefit of single non-profit.

+ Current 501(c)(3) options are:
     - Software Freedom Conservancy
     - Software in the Public Interest
     - Apache Software Foundation

+ Or, you can still go your own way.

# Software Freedom Conservancy

+ Requirements:
    - Any license on both FSF's and OSI's lists.
    - Established project.
    - Evaluation by Conservancy's Evaluation Committee.

+ Key benefits:
    - earmarked donations.
    - basic developer liability protection.
    - legal services (including license enforcement)
    - holding assets.
    - conference organizing assistance.
    - fundraising assistance.

# Software in the Public Interest

+ Requirements:
    - License meets DFSG.
    - Evaluation by Board of Directors.

+ Key benefits:
    - earmarked donations.
    - holding assets.

# Apache Software Foundation

+ Requirements:
    - Apache License.
    - Must use SVN (that's changing, so I hear)
    - Must follow &ldquo;Apache Way&rdquo;.
    - Incubator process.

+ Benefits:
    - Can apply for funding through Apache
        - (but no earmarked donations)
    - Technological infrastructure &amp; hosting.
    - basic developer liability protection.

# Going Your Own Way

+ Should only do this if you want to be a non-profit administrator
     + at least some of the time.
