# A Brief History of Affero GPL

+ Imagine the turn of the century.

+ The so-called Application Service Provider loophole.

+ In early 2001, someone said to me at an event:
         - &ldquo;I won't release my web application code at all, because the GPL is the BSD license of the web.&rdquo;

# Was this a loophole?

+ Well, it wasn't *really* a loophole

+ GPLv2 didn't (couldn't?) forsee web applications.
      + client/server barely existed when it was written.

+ Copyleft's copyright hack centered around distribution.

# The Catalyst

<img src="henry-poole.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Henry (sometimes Henri) Poole forms Allseer.
       + Which becomes Affero.

+ Web service company to encourage non-profit donations.

+ Henry points out: we have no copyleft.

# Public Performance?

+ Is it defined for software?

+ If it were, would it be enough of a copyleft hack?

+ I've long supported it as an &ldquo;at best, a no-op&rdquo; addition.
        + I've been unable to pursuade anyone else.

# The idea

+ The classic Computer Science ouroboros:
      + the program that prints its own source

+ I suggest this in the GPLv2.2 discussions in mid-September 2002, as GPLv2.2&sect;2(d)

+ Henry is excited; lawyers draft text based on my idea.

+ Affero GPL v1 is born.

+ GPL v2.2 draft includes the provision.

# The Stalling, 2002-2006

+ For various reasons, GPLv2.2 is never released.

+ Affero, Inc. (the company) goes bankrupt.

+ For various reasons, the &ldquo;FSF team&rdquo; forks.
      + And I fall into a long distraction.

+ GPLv3 process begins.

# Wait, What?!?!

+ By the time I realize what's happened:
      + Affero clause is gone from GPLv3 draft.

+ Henry insists on license upgrade.

+ AGPLv3 is born.
    + Not released until 19 November 2007

# What happened in the meantime?

+ The rise of:
       + Ruby on Rails
       + AJAX (remember that it was once called that)
       + &ldquo;Release everything but your secret sauce&rdquo;

+ Web developers didn't pick copyleft &hellip;
       + &hellip; maybe because we hadn't given them a copyleft.
       + permissive MIT license &amp; 3-clause BSD rules the web.

# The Application

+ Today, most new applications deploy online &hellp;
       + from infrastructure-level like OpenStack  &hellip;
       + to developer tools like GitHub &helip;
       + to end-user applications: FaceBook, Twitter, GooglePlus.

+ The dark ages are coming!

# Dark Ages? Really?

+ The develpoers (monks) have the source code (books).

+ The people (users) trust the power of the church (Facebook).

+ We cloistered few shall have freedom:
       + source code haves and have-nots (again!)

# Generational Change

+ Has today's developer chased a bug from the top to the bottom?

+ Will tommorow's developer ever need to?
       + Is the complexity too much anyway?

+ Will tomorrow's developer care?
       + The past cloistered missed Free Software entirely, after all.

# Hindsight

+ Maybe this was inevitable?
      + Even if GPLv2.2 came out in mid-2002:
      + Generational disconnect was the primary factor.

+ Who's AGPLv3 for today?

# The Great Abuse

<img width="274" height="383" align=right src="marten-mickos.jpg"/>

+ Proprietary relicensing (by holding all copyright).

+ license enforcement with profit as its primary (and only?) goal.

+ MySQL would shake down GPL users to buy proprietary licenses they didn't need.

+ More copyleft means more shakedowns.

+ Most common use of AGPLv3 today.

+ It makes me sick.

# Community Development

+ AGPLv3's intended for community development.

+ Lots of copyright holders:
        + all bound to each other by copyleft.

+ The great trust of copyleft.

+ Sadly, few are writing this code.

# The Great Marketing Challenge

+ The Free Software Twitter exists &hellip;
        + &hellip; StatusNet; it's AGPLv3'd
        + &hellip;  but it's a ghost-town compared to Twitter.

+ The Free Software tumblr/flickr exists &hellip;
        + &hellip; GNU Mediagoblin; it's AGPLv3'd
        + &hellip;  but it's a ghost-town compared to tumblr/flickr.

+ We're back to catching up to proprietary software:
        + Like GNU had to catch up to Unix.
        + That took almost 20 years!
