# Nature of Free Software Community

<img width="340" height="512" align=right src="detective-munch.jpg"/>

+ Through the eyes of a GPL enforcer &hellip;

+ The Free Software Community is separated into two equally important groups:
     + The permissively licensed, who use social pressure to liberate code.
     + The copyleft licensed, whose license requires liberation.

+ (Copyright infringement shouldn't be a crime, BTW: this is just an analogy.

# On Requirement By License

+ Social pressure *does* work &hellip;
     + &hellip; and should be used (and is), even for copylefted software.
     + &hellip; enforcement is a last resort.

+ GPL == Constitution of Software Freedom Land.
     + a &ldquo;written down&rdquo; embodiment of core principles.

+ GPL's a detailed implementation of the four freedoms:
     + freedom to run and study.
     + freedom to improve.
     + freedom to share.
     + freedom to share improvements.

# How GPL Works (In Reality)

<img src="copyleft-irl.jpg" align="right"  />

+ What do you do when someone violates?
     + (and social pressure for compliance fails)?

+ Copyright enforcement
     + &hellip; (yes, similar stuff to what the MPAA does: EEP!)
     + &hellip; but for a *good* cause: the four freedoms.
     + &ldquo;using the tools of the oppressor against the oppressor&rdquo;

# &ldquo;Traditional&rdquo; Compliance

+ FSF asked for copyright assignment to enforce for some GNU packages.

+ FSF's roles were admittedly tough to consider separately:
      + Employer of the authors of many GNU packages
      + copyright holder of package copyrights.
      + author of GPL &amp; related licenses.
      + advocacy organization for software freedom.

+ Confusion is really just victim of being first.

+ (Full Disclosure: I'm on FSF's Board of Directors &hellip; but also &hellip;)

# Compliance: Service to Developers

+ I'm Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ Conservancy gives a <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/members/services/">wide range of services</a> to projects.

+ Compliance is just (rather mundanely) &ldquo;one of those services.

# Compliance is Boring

+ Conservancy does the boring stuff so developers don't have to.

+ Compliance certainly qualifies.

+ Almost like a service provider &hellip;
      + &hellip; but more like a place for collaboration.

# Compliance As Collaboration

+ Multiple Conservancy projects are GPL or LGPL.

+ Nearly all agree on compliance goals:
       + Simply this: work with violators to get a source release that **works**.

+ Conservancy does the work:
        - giving updates to copyright holders involved &hellip;
        - &hellip; using the tried-and-true, simple Free Software community tool:
        - just a mailing list.

# Who Can Join?

+ Any copyright holder on an existing Conservancy project can request.
       + approval for a compliance program required by projects' leadership committee.

+ Linux developers can join &hellip;
      + &hellip; even though Linux proper isn't a Conservancy project.
      + They join through a &ldquo;special&rdquo; project &hellip;
      + GPL Compliance Project for Linux Developers.

# Why Special Case Linux?

+ Linux violations are rampant.

+ Frankly, BusyBox developers asked if we could engage.

+ Also, various Linux developers &hellip;
        - &mdash; like Matthew Garrett &mdash;
        + &mdash; had bugged Conservancy for years to help with enforcement.

+ GPL Compliance Project for Linux Developers gives structure to Linux compliance activity.

# Please Never Forget

+ GPL compliance is (roughly) only about 5-10% of what Conservancy does.

+ Most of what we do is so boring, no wants to hear me talk about it.
