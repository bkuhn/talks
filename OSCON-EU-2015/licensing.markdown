# Angels Dancing on Heads of Pins

> And Schibler with others, maketh the difference of extension to be this, that Angels can contract their whole substance into one part of space, and therefore have not partes extra partes.  Whereupon it is that the Schoolmen have questioned how many Angels may fit upon the point of a Needle?

# Licenses: Who Reads Them?

+ Think of the last time you used public network access.
      + Set your ESSID.
      + &hellip; then agree to the terms in a browser.

+ By show of hands: how many of you read those terms?

# Licenses: Who Reads Them?

+ Well, I *always* read them.

+ I've seen some that prohibit &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; activity.
     + How often are the violated?

+ What permissions you have matter!
     + &hellip; while this is a &ldquo;toy&rdquo; example.
     + &hellip; but many licenses you agree to have serious consequences.

# What the License Says Matters

<img src="google-guardian-article.png" align="center" />

# Why Use This System?

+ Many software freedom advocates disagree with the concept of software
  licensing.

+ So why do we use such things?

# Why Do We Need Licenses?

+ Software is governed by copyright &hellip;
       + &hellip; since it's expression fixed in a tangible medium.

+ Only way to give rights to users is to grant a copyright license.

+ What rights do you get?

# Ye Ol' Four Freedoms

+ to use.

+ to learn and modify for yourself.

+ to copy and share.

+ to modify and share modified versions.

# What a Free Software License Does?

+ Copyright on software governs three basic activities:
      + copying, modifying and distributing.

+ By default, you're prohibited from doing those things.

+ A license is:
      + a document that gives you permissions &hellip;
      + &hellip; that you otherwise wouldn't have.

+ A software freedom license, first and foremost:
      + assert recipient's to copy, share, modify and redistribute the software.

# How Do I Know?

+ There are (unfortunately) a lot of Open Source / Free Software licenses.

+ Fortunately, there are two authorities:
      + [Free Software Foundation's List of GPL-Compatible Free Software Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses)
      + [Open Source Initiative's Open Source License List](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)

+ Easy rule: feel pretty safe with any license that's on both lists.

+ But there are more policy issues to consider.

# Is Policy Boring?

+ Some people find software licensing a boring topic:
     + but most people find other policy debates, such as tax policy, even more boring.

+ I find all of it fascinating:
     + Ultimately, these codes implement policy.

# Tax Policy

+ What Is a Tax Write-Off (deduction)?
      + It's a government incentive to encourage certain behavior.

+ What Is a Tax Penalty?
      + It's a government incentive to discourage certain behavior.

+ We can argue what the right policies are.

+ But understanding them is a rote application of this principle.

# Licensing Policy

+ Licensing policy works somewhat like any other policy (e.g., tax code)
  incentive/discouragement structures.

+ Typically, a software freedom / open source license:
      + **permits** on behavior it seeks to encourage.
      + **places extra requirements** for behavior it seeks to discourage.

# The Simplest Free Software License

+ ISC License (w/out warranty disclaimer)

Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any

# Does/Should a License Do More?

+ Ultimately depends on the authors' goal.
      + More on this in a moment.

+ Every Free Software license gives first recipient those four freedoms.

+ Question is: What about everyone else?

# Basics of Copyleft Licensing

+ Concept: share and share alike.

+ Accomplished via copyright requirements:
      + distribution accompanied with complete, corresponding source.
      + distribution of modified versions need same (with changes).

+ Generally triggered on distribution:
      + (Note: Affero GPL triggers on modification.)

# Other Policy and Rules?

+ Warranty disclaimers.

+ Patent policy.

+ Attribution requirements.

# Comparing Licenses

# Meta-License Policy

+ inbound=outbound
     + Your hold copyright on your own contributions.
     + You offer those changes under the project's license.

+ Other arrangements
     + CLAs, &copy;AAs, and many others.
     + These are common, but create inequality.

+ If the license is good enough for the project, it should be good enough for
  contributions.

# A Final Example

+ How many Mac users are in the room?

+ How many GNU/Linux users?

# Does Free Software Remain Free?

+ Both Macs and GNU/Linux are based on Free Software.

+ Macs are based on BSD, but Apple modified and made it proprietary.

+ Linux is GPL'd, so policy prohibits proprietary modifications.
