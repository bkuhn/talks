# I'm not Leslie

+ Leslie recommended to the conference organizers I replace her as keynote
  after a family emergency.

+ But sadly I *cannot* cover the topic she promised you.
     + &ldquo;Making Money in Open Source is Easier Than You Think&rdquo;


# My Unique Job Formula

+ I do make a living using, developing, advocating for, and defending *only*
  Open Source and Free Software.
     + by working in one of the very few jobs at the few charities focused on
       these issues.
     + There are, all told, maybe a dozen jobs like this.
     + I consider myself lucky to have one, but it's not an easily reproducible formula.

+ In my experience, it's actually not so easy to earn a living
in any field related to software while refusing all proprietary software.
     + (so Leslie and I probably disagree on this point).

+ I have always prioritized the ethics of software freedom above business models &amp; revenue.

# My History

+ I was in a CS PhD program (1997-2000).
    + while being a volunteer Free Software developer on various projects (e.g., Perl).
    + Dropped out to be Free Software Foundation's Executive Director.

+ I've since worked and/or volunteered for most of the non-profit
  organizations in Open Source and Free Software.

+ Now I help run one such charity called Software Freedom Conservancy.

# &amp; Being a Grad School Dropout &hellip;

+ I'm not a researcher.

+ My interests led me to become a policy wonk.

+ But, I don't do rigorous peer-reviewed research like you.

+ My actual &ldquo;day job&rdquo; is three (er, four) roles:
      + software freedom activist.
      + software freedom advocate.
      + Open Source politician.
      + (and, admittedly) non-profit administrator.

# My Observations

+ My observations are thus anecdotal &ldquo;case studies&rdquo; (of sorts).

+ I'm an &ldquo;observational reporter&rdquo; on the &ldquo;front lines&rdquo; of the software freedom movement.

+ I can likely point out areas you might want to study.

+ But I admit I'm really here to to recruit you to my cause of seeking
  universal software freedom.
     + which really is a subset of the pursuit of academic knowledge and
     truth.

# FLOSS/Academic Intersection

+ Initially, a tight connection:
     + BSD and GNU both trace their history to academic roots.

+ USENIX initially fostered &amp; celebrated this connection:
     + Free Software activists &amp; academic researchers all went to the
       same conferences in the mid-1990s.
     + That ended, almost abruptly.

+ [Atlanta Linux Showcase](http://linuxshowcase.org/) debacle.

+ &ldquo;These Free Software people won't write papers&rdquo;.

# FLOSS Uniquely Worthy of Study

<img src="lab-rat.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Social scientists blazed the trail of studying FLOSS itself:
    - Anthropologists
    - Business schools
    - Sociologists

+ I was a &ldquo;lab rat&rdquo; in four different studies in the early 2000s.
    - including a Harvard Business School PhD student shadowing FSF's staff
      for a week in 2002.

# FLOSS Uniquely Worthy of Study

+ It's truly an honor to do work worthy of rigorous academic study.

+ My only regrets:
    - some political science research might ferret out now-rampant FLOSS
      governance shift from individuals to for-profit companies.
    - I wish more researchers would &ldquo;go native&rdquo; (even just a little).

# Computer Science Research

+ Computer scientists did ultimately come around to FLOSS.
    - at least as an essential data set.
    - seems to be true in many areas (compiler optimization, software
      engineering, etc.)

+ But the paper/implementation divide is bigger than ever.

+ This relates more to what institutions value than individuals.

# Academic Patent Licensing

+ MIT gets [USA Patent 4,405,829](https://www.google.com/patents/US4405829) on [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29).

+ USA is a &ldquo;first to invent&rdquo; jurisdiction (until 2011).

+ MIT launches spin-off: RSA Data Security.

+ Sets back adoption of public key cryptography by a decade (IMO).
     - in part because it completely bans any Free Software implementation of
       RSA.
     
# The Cycle

+ Government funds research.

+ Universities gain patents &amp; copyrights.

+ Universities launch spin-offs.

+ Universities get money.

# Unintended consequences?

<img src="shuttleworth-spacesuit.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Ever wonder why he's so wealthy?

# Selling Patented Tech From Outside USA

+ RSA was published in 1977; patented years later.

+ Few places in the world are &ldquo;first to invent&rdquo;.
       + Thus, [RSA patent applies only in a few countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29#Patent).

+ Shuttleworth's [Thwate sells RSA certificates back to USA cheaply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thawte#Origins).
       + Undercuts USA-based providers.
       + Gains 50% of the SSL certificate market.

+ I'm amazed that a USA government-funded University research invention's
  biggest single beneficiary is one very wealthy South African.

# Isn't This Technology Transfer?

<img src="CACM-cover-1996-09.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Perennial issue for academic research.

+ Corporate spin-offs aren't **charitable** technology transfer.
      + Does it fulfill University's 501(c)(3) mission?
      + USA IRS legality is <a href="http://www.mcguirewoods.com/news-resources/publications/taxation/TaxationofExempts-May-June2010.pdf">an &ldquo;open question&rdquo;</a>.

+ Academics can take lead here.

+ **Companies** have gladly &ldquo;outsourced&rdquo; much of their R&D to
  FLOSS communities, but academia has not.

# The Case for Science

+ Key principle of scientific method is verifiable, reproducible results.

+ If you utilize software in scientific inquiry, then the software must be as
  freely available as the paper.

+ This **is** the founding principle of software freedom: that everyone
  should have equal rights &amp; access to improve and build on the work that
  came before.

+ This isn't what happens.  (Anonymous) examples follow:

# The Practitioner's Deep Dive

+ Every 2 years or so, I have a complex technical problem I need to solve for
  my job.

+ I'll typically spend a week deep diving into the papers on the subject.

+ Roadblocks come from two directions:

# Literature Paywalls

+ The problem of a lone practitioner getting access to papers is slowly improving.

+ It's becoming more rare to find academic researchers who don't have their
  own papers on their website.

+ More on this connection later.

# Guessing Games W/ Research Systems

+ Almost any area of study in CS seems to have a least a few research
  codebases.

+ The so-called &ldquo;academic licensing&rdquo; model is common:
     - no source available
     - non-commercial use only
     - (it's rarely clear if a charity is non-commercial, BTW)

# Guessing Games W/ Research Systems

+ Bizarre licensing structures
     - recently got an a source release I couldn't build &hellip;
     - &hellip; and the license prohibited any modifications, so I couldn't fix it!
     
+ Why not just ask?

# Just Ask?: Hasn't Yet Worked!

+ A common response when I raise this:
     - &ldquo;just asks researchers, they'll often release/fix license&rdquo;

+ Well, I do ask.
      - Often.
      - I did so on three different occasions last month.
      - I've probably asked more than 100 CS researchers over the last 20
        years to release some codebase they created related to their research.
      - I've **yet** to get a &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.

# A Particularly Egregious Example

+ In one case, the work had been presented 2 years ago at FOSDEM.
      - The speaker was asked on camera to release by many in audience.
      - (it was an add-on plugin to a non-copylefted codebase).
      - Answer in early 2015: &ldquo;I'll think about it&rdquo;
      - Answer three weeks ago (by email):  &ldquo;I am sorry, but we are not going to open source&rdquo;

# Lack Of Codebases for Students

+ Multiple CS researchers have lamented how few codebases in their field
  exist for students to test their ideas.

+ Students often must write new research systems from scratch.

# Continuing Collaborations?

+ A researcher recently told me (paraphrased):
    + &ldquo;I switched from one academic institution to another &amp; now I can't
      collaborate with my old colleagues because the system was never
      released publicly.&rdquo;
    + &ldquo;If I'd only Open-Source'd it, that wouldn't have happened.&rdquo;

+ The decision is so often in your hands.

# All Politics Are Local

+ Yes, your institution might have policies about your copyrights.

+ But these policies are often advised, if not outright set, based on faculty
  committees' recommendations.

+ You can be an activist for good science *and* FLOSS in your institution.

# ACM Paper Copyright Policy

+ In fall 2011, a
[blogosphere](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/dwallach/tinkering-ieee-and-acm-copyright-policies/) [outcry](http://r6.ca/blog/20110930T012533Z.html)
[developed](http://blog.dshr.org/2011/10/acm-copyrights.html)
[among](http://www.crypto.com/blog/copywrongs) [academics](https://se9book.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/acm-considered-harmful/).

+ The ACM was effectively pressured to [change its copyright policy](http://www.acm.org/news/featured/author-rights-management).

+ The upshot: that problem I used to have (not being able to occasionally
  read papers without cost-prohibitive subscriptions) is quite rare.

+ Scientists win when they stand up for open science.

# What Can I Do?

+ I've made a call for academics to demand liberation of research software.

+ Please tell me:
     + What should software freedom activists do to help you do that? 

+ Some ideas:
     + Licensing education for academics?
     + Advocacy geared to students?
     + Writing/speaking about issue in specific venues?
