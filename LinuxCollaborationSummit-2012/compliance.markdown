% GPL Compliance Is Easier Than You Think

# My History

+ Worked my first GPL enforcement case in 1999 (as FSF volunteer).

+ Started working for FSF in 2000 (was there until 2005).  Now on FSF Board of Directors.

+ Now: Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy &amp; on Board of Directors of the FSF.

+ Plurality of my time since 1999 has been spent on GPL enforcement.
     + I'm probably the key person &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for every major USA GPL enforcement action.

+ Conservancy &amp; FSF are responsible for nearly all GPL enforcement in the USA.

+ This is a talk about how you never have to hear from me.

# They Say Compliance is Hard &hellip;

+ FUD says: compliance is difficult.

+ FUD says: you should fear enforcement.

# The &ldquo;Compliance&rdquo; Industry

+ I'm disturbed Harald Welte &amp; I've created the &ldquo;compliance&rdquo; industry.

+ Ironically, this industry wants enforcement to seem worse than it is.

+ It behooves them when others spread FUD.

# FUD Becomes Marketing

<img src="pick-flick.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Salespeople live to sell you things you don't already need.

+ Most who talk about &ldquo;compliance&rdquo; want to sell you products you don't need.

+ Fear of enforcement is their motivator.

+ Educate yourself:
      + Ask people  who do enforcement, rather than sales people.

# On Requirement By License

<img src="Constitution.jpg" align="right"  />

+ GPL == Constitution of Software Freedom Land.
     + a &ldquo;written down&rdquo; embodiment of core principles.

+ GPL's a detailed implementation of the four freedoms:
     + freedom to run and study.
     + freedom to improve.
     + freedom to share.
     + freedom to share improvements.

+ Any strict rules in copyleft licenses are designed to uphold these freedoms.

# Have You Ever Ignored One of These?

<img src="speed-limit-55.gif" align="right"  />

# How Badly?

+ Routinely 10 over limit?

+ Routinely 20 over limit?

+ Routinely 30 over limit?

+ Routinely 40 over limit?

# And If You Drove a Commercial Vehicle?

<img src="commercial-truck.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Nearly all GPL violations are by for-profit companies.

+ They absolutely increase their profits by failing to comply.

+ They undercut those who comply.

+ But it's still a matter of degree.

> And Schibler with others, maketh the difference of extension to be this, that Angels can contract their whole substance into one part of space, and therefore have not partes extra partes.  Whereupon it is that the Schoolmen have questioned how many Angels may fit upon the point of a Needle?

# Not All Violations Are Equal

+ It's fun to debate esoteric licensing situations &amp; details &hellip;

+ &hellip; but it doesn't address the fundamental problem:

+ hundreds of egregious violations are ongoing and mostly ignored.

# Egregious Violations

+ The primary point of any copyleft license:
    + &hellip; is to make sure source code is available.
    + &hellip; and make sure it is the *right* source code. 

+ Nearly all the violations I handle are:
     + no-source-nor-offer: complete diregard for GPLv2&sect;3 / GPLv3&sect;6 
     + offer-fail: bogus offer for source under GPLv2&sect;3(b) / GPLv3&sect;6(b)

+ I've been doing this 13 years &amp; the &ldquo;egregious&rdquo; queue has never been near empty.

# I Know You Won't Be Perfect

+ Believe it or not, I'm a pragmatist.

+ But I'm oft-accused of wanting perfect compliance.
     + (Mainly by people who don't really like copyleft too much.)

+ Oddly, the compliance industry seek perfection:
     + Probably because perfection costs more.

# FUD Overhead on LWN

> It is possible for a mistake made by an ODM (like providing the wrong busybox source version) could result in the recall of millions of unrelated products.
***

+ Sure, this is possible in theory &hellip;

+ &hellip; but who doing enforce is asking for this in practice?

+ I've accepted *disgusting* settlement terms sometimes just to avoid disrupting a violator's business.

# FUD Overheard on LWN

> [I've] heard occasional worries about the prospect of "copyright trolls." It's not too hard to imagine that somebody with a trollish inclination might come into possession of the copyright on some kernel code; that somebody could then go shaking down former violators with threats of lawsuits for ongoing infringement.

*** 

+ You need to read the statute.

+ You can't get rich suing for copyright infringement &hellip;
     + &hellip; particularly if you've already granted a rather broad license.

+ Anyway, if you believe non-profit enforcement  &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; these copyright trolls
     + &hellip; it's already too late on that one.

# Challenges of Modern Compliance

+ Saavy violators means intelligent discussion.

+ Clueless violators means difficult conversations:
     + Me: &ldquo;Your software violates GPL.&rdquo;
     + Them: &ldquo;We make hardware.&rdquo;
     + Me: &ldquo;I know, but it has software in it.  Our members' software. Under the GPL.&rdquo;
     + Them: &ldquo;No, it doesn't. We make hardware.&rdquo;
     + Me: &ldquo;But your firmware download&hellip;on *your* website&hellip;that's software.&rdquo;
     + Them: &ldquo;Oh, that's not ours.  We got that from someone.  Nothing to do with us.&rdquo;

+ Having the above conversation across four phone calls every two months is why I seem so insane most of the time.

# A Radical Statement

+ Copyleft compliance isn't a legal problem &hellip;

+ &hellip; or even a &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; problem &hellip;

+ &hellip; it's an engineering problem.

# The Easy Parts of Compliance

+ Fixing copyright notices

+ Clarifying contradictory license texts

+ Other informational requirements

# The Only Hard Part of Compliance

+ C&amp;CS: complete and corresponding source code.

+ Bulk of all enforcement time is spent on this.

+ It's hard because violators won't let me talk to engineers &hellip;

+ &hellip; or they don't know who they are.

# On Asking for Complete Compliance

+ *All* GPL enforcers ask for this (including Harald).

+ Indeed, most violators ask for this.

+ As an engineering question, this is easier!

+ Build scripts are usually for the whole system, not just one program.

+ Universal compliance means:
     + the enforcer becomes your expert witness &hellip;
     + &hellip; should those mythical &ldquo;copyright trolls&rdquo; show up.

# Other Requests (They're Easy)

+ Notification to past recipients.

+ Appoint GPL Compliance Officer.

+ Periodic compliance reports.

+ Yes, we do ask for some money.

# Money

+ No one in non-profits is getting rich from this.

+ Who should pay for enforcement: 
     - Those who *comply* or those who *violate*?
     - Individual donors?

+ There must be a deterrent.

+ Non-profit enforcement == accountability.

+ Confidentiality is something violators ask for.


# GPLv2: More than Just Source

+ &ldquo;the scripts to control&hellip;&rdquo; gets us close.

+ It handles most of the issues.

+ I even argued it includes authorized install information.
     + Unfortunately, RMS gave in on that one.

# GPLv3: Installation Information

<span class="fitonslide">
<p><strong>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo;</strong> for a User Product <strong>means any methods,
procedures</strong>, authorization keys, <strong>or</strong> other <strong>information required to install
and execute modified versions</strong> of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The <strong>information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code</strong> is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</p>

<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.</p>
</span>

<p>(emphasis mine)</p>

# GPLv3: Installation Information

+ In my view, just clarifies GPLv2's terse wording.

+ In any event, it makes it certain.

+ Users of device can modify and upgrade their devices &hellip;
     + &hellip; as it should be.

+ This is one of the reasons projects should upgrade to GPLv3.

# Today.

<img align="right" height="473" width="557" src="DQWindmill.gif"/>

+ I continue enforcement for Conservancy.
     - new reports each week.

+ BusyBox often stands alone &hellip;
     + &hellip; and is frustrated by that.

+ I wish more individuals and non-profits would enforce.

# Constant Vigilance!

<img align="right" src="moody.jpg"/>

+ GPL Violations *are* *everywhere*.

+ My only recourse is &hellip;
     - Constant Vigilance!

+ I'm not giving up on this &hellip;
       + &hellip; until there is no developer left in the world &hellip;
       + &hellip; who cares to enforce the GPL for the rights of users &hellip;
       + &hellip; no matter how many embedded companies try to make me stop &hellip;
       + &hellip; or how many anti-GPL developers they recruit to try to stop me.
