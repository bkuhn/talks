# What's This About?

+ For many of us, we're not just in this for the money.

+ We'd like to be employed &hellip;

+ &hellip; doing something we enjoy &hellip;

+ &hellip; making software do cool things on computers.


# In The Beginning ...

<img align=right src="pdp-10.jpg" />

+ There was a computer.

+ There were terminals.

+ There were users.

+ ... and the users had freedom.

# Ye Ol' Four Freedoms

+ to use.

+ to learn and modify for yourself.

+ to copy and share.

+ to modify and share modified versions.

# &hellip; Then Freedom Eluded Us

+ They built licensing walls.

+ By separating the software from the computer.

<p>As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. &hellip; [If] software is something to share &hellip; You prevent good software from being written.</p>

+ Gates convinces IBM to license rather then acquire DOS.

+ Job at MIT's AI lab in late 1970s and early 1980s.

+ Programming their PDP-10!

+ In the Golden Age.

# MIT AI Lab: The Golden Age

 - academic computing.
 - software sharing.
 - no licenses!

MIT changed.

# MIT AI Lab

<cite>patents == $$$</cite>

# MIT AI Lab

<cite>spin-offs == $$$</cite>

# Software Freedom and Money?

+ Licensing doesn't account for most software revenue.

+ Most software business models are software-freedom-compatible:
    + services
    + support contracts
    + warranty/indemnification
    + custom modifications/improvements by contract

+ All work with proprietary software, too.

+ But doing it with Free Software is better for your career.


# Jeremy Allison

+ &ldquo;I quit Novell in protest over the Novell/Microsoft deal.&rdquo;

+ &ldquo;My punishment for this political protest was I had to take a cushy job at Google.&rdquo;

+ How did Jeremy get to do that?


# Project Maintainers Are Always Employable

+ Most software businesses today rely on some Free Software components:
     + Samba
     + Linux
     + GCC
     + Selenium
     + jQuery
     + Git
     + to name just a few examples!

+ Leaders of these codebases are always employable.

# Why You Should Know a Public Codebase

+ The knowledge is the most transferable around.

+ You collaborate with people outside your own organization.

+ You collaborate with the most talented developers in the field.


# How To Get Started

+ These communities are open and free.

+ Often, all it takes is joining a mailing list.

+ Be prepared to to do &ldquo;grunt&rdquo; work to start.

+ Learn the developer tools (bug tracker, DVCS, etc.).

+ Participate in Google Summer of Code.
