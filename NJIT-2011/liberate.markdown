# What's This About?

+ For many of us, we're not in this for the money.

+ We'd like to be employed &hellip;

+ &hellip; doing something we enjoy &hellip;

+ &hellip; making software do cool things on computers.


# In The Beginning ...

<img align=right src="pdp-10.jpg" />

+ There was a computer.

+ There were terminals.

+ There were users.

+ ... and the users had freedom.

# Ye Ol' Four Freedoms

+ to use.

+ to learn and modify for yourself.

+ to copy and share.

+ to modify and share modified versions.

# &hellip; Then Freedom Eluded Us

+ They built licensing walls.

+ By separating the software from the computer.

+ Who Invented Licensing?

Some think he did:

<p>As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. &hellip; [If] software is something to share &hellip; You prevent good software from being written.</p>

<br clear="all"/>

+ Gates convinces IBM to license rather then acquire DOS.

+ Job at MIT's AI lab in late 1970s and early 1980s.

+ Programming their PDP-10!

+ In the Golden Age.

 - academic computing.
 - software sharing.
 - no licenses!

# Restoring Natural Rights

+ Software Freedom activists believe four freedoms are inalienable rights &hellip;

+ &hellip; that every developer and users should have &hellip;

+ &hellip; developers &amp; sysadmins are left helpless without software freedom.

+ Proprietary software is actually harmful.

# Software Freedom and Money?

+ Licensing *doesn't* account for most software revenue.

+ Most software business models are software-freedom-compatible:
    + services
    + support contracts
    + warranty/indemnification
    + custom modifications/improvements by contract

+ All exist with proprietary software, too &hellip;

+ &hellip; but doing it with Free Software is better for your career.

# Jeremy Allison

<img src="800px-Jeremy_allison.jpg" align="right"  />

+ &ldquo;I quit Novell in protest over the Novell/Microsoft deal.&rdquo;

+ &ldquo;My punishment for this political protest was I had to take a cushy job at Google.&rdquo;

+ How did Jeremy get to do that?

# Maintainers Are Always Employable

+ Most software businesses today rely on some Free Software components:
     + Samba
     + Linux
     + GCC
     + Selenium
     + jQuery
     + Git
     + &hellip; to name just a few examples!

+ Leaders of these codebases are always employable.

# Indeed, They Can Get Away With This!

# Software Freedom For a Living

+ Your allegiance is to the community project, not your employer.

+ Employers actually *like* this.

+ They want people who are connected to and have authority in the community.

# Luis Rodriguez

<img src="luis-rodriguez.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Invited me to speak at Rutgers in 2002.

+ Had just started working on wireless device drivers as part of Rutgers research project.

+ Stayed on University staff after graduation.

+ Got hired by Atheros.

+ Now is the key Open Source expert inside Qualcomm.

# Why Know a Public Codebase?

+ Admittedly, these examples are anecdotal. YMMV.

+ But, Free Software knowledge is clearly transferable.

+ You collaborate with people outside your own organization.

+ You collaborate with the most talented developers in the field.

# How To Get Started

+ These communities are open and free.

+ Often, all it takes is joining a mailing list.

+ Be prepared to to do &ldquo;grunt&rdquo; work to start.

+ Learn the developer tools (bug tracker, DVCS, etc.).

+ Offer patches to fix documented, minor bugs at first.
     + Prepare to have your first few patches rejected.

+ Participate in Google Summer of Code: http://code.google.com/soc/
