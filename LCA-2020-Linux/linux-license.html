  <h3 class="top-title">Why Should You Care?</h3>

  <p class="fragment">Engineers and developers like to do cool things with
    computing.</p>
  <p><span class="fragment">It's totally reasonable that you might feel licensing
      just gets in your way</span> <span class="fragment">&hellip; and you're
      probably right.</span></p>
    <p class="fragment">My goal is to give you enough information so that
      licensing doesn't get in your way&hellip;</p>
    <p class="fragment">&hellip; and maybe you'll be able to teach others
      too.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">You <em>Can</em> Learn this license stuff.</h3>

<q> Every great wizard in history has started out as nothing
  more than what we are now, students. If they can do it, why not us?</q>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Things Even Non-Lawyers Should Know</h3>
  <p class="fragment">I am not a lawyer either.</p>
  <p class="fragment">I can't give you legal advice, but &hellip;</p>
  <p class="fragment">This talk can help you ask much more intelligent
  questions of lawyers when you have a question about your engineering and
    development work.</p></section> 

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">So, let's focus on Software</h3>

  <p class="fragment">Let's consider what it means to get a software
    license.</p>

  <p class="fragment">A license, in non-lawyer terms, is a bundle of
    permissions wrapped with a bundle of requirements.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Proprietary licenses  rely primarily on <em>contract
      law</em> as the foundation of their licenses.</p>
  <p class="fragment">FOSS licenses rely primarily on <em>copyright law</em>
    as the foundation of their licenses.</p>
  <p class="fragment">(but both draw from other legal regimes as well)</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">What Is Software?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Software is a series of textual statements.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Text, in our legal system, is governed by
  copyright.</p>

  <p class="fragment">The primary system that governs software is therefore
  copyright.</p>
</section>  
<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">What Does Copyright Govern?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Copyright was invented primarily for books.</p>
  <p class="fragment">It governs permission to copy, distribute, and modify
  a &ldquo;work&rdquo;.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Engaging in those activities is otherwise prohibited.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Does/Should a License Do More?</h2>

  <p class="fragment">Ultimately depends on the authors' goal.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Every FOSS license gives those basic rights and permissions.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Some licenses &ldquo;do more&rdquo;.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">What is Copyleft?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Copyleft utilizes copyright to achieve a policy system
    that assures software freedom.</p>
  <p class="fragment">First: asserts your rights to copy, modify and
  distribute the software.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Second: adds conditional requirements on those
  activities, when such requirements help assure the software freedom of
  others.</p>
</section>
<section class="copious">
 <h1 class="top-title">Copyleft Is a Tool, Not a Principle</h1>
<p>
<q class="copious">Copyleft is a <span class="fragment highlight-green">strategy</span> of
utilizing copyright law to pursue the policy goal of fostering &amp;
encouraging the equal &amp; inalienable right to copy, share, modify &amp;
improve creative works of authorship. Copyleft &hellip; describes any method
that utilizes the copyright system to achieve the aforementioned
goal. Copyleft as a concept is usually implemented in the details of a
specific copyright license &hellip; Copyright holders of creative work can
unilaterally implement these licenses for their own works to build
communities that collaboratively share &amp; improve those copylefted
creative works.
<p align=right> &mdash; Definition of copyleft from
  <a href="https://copyleft.org">copyleft.org</a> </q>
</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Details of the GPL</h3>
  <p class="fragment">The General Public License (GPL) is a
    specific <em>implementation</em> of copyleft.</p>
    <p class="fragment">Copyleft can apply to any copyrightable work, but GPL
      focuses on copyleft for software.</p>
    <p class="fragment">GPL has detailed rules to assure downstream users
    &amp; developers  benefit from the software
      freedoms assured by copyleft in any  <em>effective</em>
      way.</p></section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">The Mindset of GPL</h3>

<p class="fragment">Ultimate goal: make sure every user has the four software
  freedoms:</p>

<ul><li class="fragment">to run the software.</li>
    <li class="fragment">to study and modify the software.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Freedom to share the software.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Freedom to distribute modified versions.</li></ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Using Copyright</h3>
  <p class="fragment">GPL is primarily a copyright license.</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">software is copyrighted.</li>
    <li class="fragment">License grants key freedoms.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Requirements prohibit activities that take away
      freedoms.</li>
    <li class="fragment">You may do <em>A</em>, &ldquo;provided that&rdquo;
    you do <em>B</em></li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">&ldquo;Strong&rdquo; Copyleft</h3>
  <p class="fragment">License like the General Public License (GPL) are
  known as <strong>strong</strong> copyleft.</p>

  <p class="fragment">A <strong>strong</strong> copyleft license typically
  seeks to extend its scope of coverage to the breadth of derivative and/or
  combined works that the copyright statue allows.</p>
</section>  
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">&ldquo;Weak&rdquo; Copyleft</h3>
  <p class="fragment">By contrast, a <strong>weak</strong> copyleft license
  unilaterally provides some detailed rules that permit creation and/or
  distribution of certain types of proprietary combinations and/or
  derivations that would require a copyright holder's permissions and that a
  strong copyleft license would forbid.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Modification As a Center Provision</h3>
  <p class="fragment">GPL's primary copyright hook is copyright controls on the right to modify.</p>

  <p class="fragment">GPL's central tenant:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">You can make a modified version of various types privately as much as you'd like.</li>
  <li class="fragment">When you distribute that modified version, you have
    requirements to meet.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">[GPLv2&sect;]2</h3>
<p class="copious">[GPLv2&sect;]2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br/>
<br/>
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br/>
<br/>
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.
</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Derivative Works</h3>
  <p>Everyone  wants a good <em>risk
      analysis</em><span class="fragment">, but</span><span class="fragment">: why would they <em>want</em> to test the  boundary?</span></p>
  <p class="fragment">You should
  certainly <a href="https://copyleft.org/guide/comprehensive-gpl-guidech5.html#x8-300004">read
  the section in the <cite>Copyleft Guide</cite></a>.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Rarely does the derivative work question actually come up.</p>
  <p class="fragment"><strong>Removing</strong> the copylefted software is
  always an option.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Source Code Matters</h3>
  <p class="fragment">The freedom to modify is essential; source code is
    mandatory for modifications.</p>
      <p class="fragment">Many provisions in GPL focus on details of source
        code disclosure.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 class="top-title"> Binaries (Object Code) are Modifications</h3>
<p class="fragment">Software that the computer understands is different than
  software humans  read.</p>

<p class="fragment">There is often a process required to modify (and/or
  translate) the software from human-readable to computer-readable.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">A Legal Mechanism for Technical Details</h3>
      <p class="fragment">While hearing it's a copyright license might
      indicate the lawyer is the most important expert to understand the license&hellip;
      <p class="fragment">&hellip;in fact, most of the confusion around
        copyleft are more <em>technology-focused</em>
        than <em>legally-focused</em>.</p>
      <p class="fragment">Indeed, the most important requirement
        is <strong>complete, corresponding source (CCS).</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Copyleft at its Core</h3>
<p>At its core, copyleft's primary goal is to give downstream users the means
  and capacity to generate and utilize binaries in the same manner that
  upstream did.</p>
</section>

<section class="copious">
  <h3 class="top-title">How GPLv2 Says CCS</h3>

<q class="copious">
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under § 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of § 1 &amp; 2 above provided that you … [a]ccompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code … The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.</q>
<p align="right">
&mdash; GPLv2§3
</p></section>

<section>
<h3 class="top-title">Testing CCS</h3>
<p class="fragment">
  Evaluating CCS is often a “know it when I see it” standard.
  <span class="fragment">(i.e., can you take the CCS build it, and install it?)</span></p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 class="top-title">Best Way to Test CCS?</h3>
<p class="fragment">Find an embedded engineer who <strong>didn't</strong>
  work on the product and ask that engineer to build from sources a new
  firmware and install it on the device.</p></section>
<section>
<h3 class="top-title">Why So Much Copyleft?</h3>
<p class="fragment">I admit, copyleft is my favorite form of licensing.</p>
<p class="fragment">The classic joke is that &ldquo;the ISC license is simple
  because it doesn't actually <strong>do</strong> anything&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="fragment">But let's briefly take a comparative look at FOSS
  licensing&hellip;</p></section>

<section>
<h3 class="top-title">Comparing Licenses</h3>

<img src="img/license-spectrum.png" align="center" />
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Additional Permissions</h3>

  <p class="fragment">Licenses are, in fact, hackable just like software.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Take a &ldquo;strong&rdquo; license and make it
    slightly (or a lot!) &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; by adding an <strong>additional
      permission</strong>.</p>
  <p class="fragment">These are also often called <em>exceptions</em>&hellip;</p>
    <p class="fragment">(&hellip; but I find the latter term confusing given
      the overload of the term <em>exception</em> in
      programming.)</p></section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Linux's License</h3>

  <p class="fragment">(Thanks for your patience, I realize it took me this
    much time to mention Linux at all.)</p>
  <p class="fragment">Linux is a complex project <em>technically</em>, so it's not
    surprisingly it complex <em>license-wise</em> too.</p>

  <p class="fragment">I recommend this simple mantra:

  <p class="fragment"><strong>&ldquo;the effective
  license of Linux as a whole is GPLv2-only, but many additional permissions
    exist on much of its code.&rdquo;</strong></p></section>

<section>
<h3 class="top-title">What's GPLv2-<strong>only</strong>?</h3>

<p>GPL is one of very few FOSS licenses that don't have an
  &ldquo;auto-upgrade&rdquo; clause.</p>

<p class="fragment">Auto-upgrade means the <span class="fragment highlight-green">license steward</span> controls
  forward-licensing of the code under yet unpublished versions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">What's a License Steward?</h3>

  <p class="fragment">A license steward is someone who publishes the text of
    a FOSS license that is <em>reusable</em> for other copyright holders.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Between FOSS licenses and the ability to
    write <em>additional permissions</em>, you often have the tools you need
    to craft interesting licensing solutions; usually, no fresh license
    drafting is needed.</p>
</section>  
<section>
<h3 class="top-title">What's GPLv2-<strong>only</strong>?</h3>

<p>GPL is one of very few FOSS licenses that don't have an
  <span class="fragment highlight-green">&ldquo;auto-upgrade&rdquo;</span> clause.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 class="top-title">What's Auto-upgrade?</h3>
<p class="fragment">Auto-upgrade means the license steward controls
  forward-licensing of the code under yet unpublished drafts of the license.</p>
<p class="fragment">Using Eclipse Public License, Apache Public License (and
  almost all  of the popular non-GNU licenses) means you give those
  organization (Eclipse Foundation, Apache Software Foundation, etc.) the
  right to relicense your code <strong>any way they wish</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 class="top-title">What's Auto-upgrade?</h3>
<p class="fragment">Auto-upgrade also means: when the license steward publishes a
  new version of the license, that action <em>automatically</em> changes the
  license on millions of third-party lines of code overnight.</p></section>

<section>
<h3 class="top-title">Why Auto-upgrade?</h3>
<p class="fragment">I'm not a fan of a forced auto-upgrade; I prefer the GPL
  model, even though it's more complicated.</p>
<p class="fragment">The key feature of auto-upgrade clauses is
  simplicity.</p>
<p class="fragment">Don't believe the hype: Linux's license, my friends, is not simple.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Down Linux's Licensing Rabbit-Hole</h3>

  <p class="fragment">Opinions of Linux developers differ widely about
    GPLv3.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Many Linux developers license their code
  GPLv2-<strong>only</strong> (forbid upgrade), rather than
    GPLv2-<strong>or-later</strong> (opt-in auto-upgrade)  because they
    dislike GPLv3.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Linux has lots of GPLv2-only and GPLv2-or-later code
    mixed together.</p>  
  <p class="fragment">You can &ldquo;downgrade&rdquo; the <em>effective</em>
    license back to GPLv2-only.</p></section>
<section>
<h3 class="top-title">Linux syscall Exception</h3>
<q>
  NOTE! This copyright [sic] does <strong>not</strong> cover user programs
 that use kernel services by normal system calls - this is merely considered
 normal use of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived
 work".
</q></section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">What's a syscall?</h3>

  <p class="fragment">Let's consider what this means.</p>
  <p class="fragment">It's an interesting licensing analysis &mdash; because
    technical folks are actually better equipped to think about this than
    lawyers.</p>
  <p class="fragment">What would someone reasonable skilled in the art
    consider a &ldquo;normal system call&rdquo;?</p></section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Linux API to userspace</h3>
  <p class="fragment">syscalls are the method that non-kernel-space programs
    ask the kernel for the resources that it manages. </p>
  <p class="fragment">(e.g., memory, file system, peripherals, etc.)</p>
  <p class="fragment">The Linux syscall exception tell us, &ldquo;when you do
  this in the normal way with the normal mechanism, we don't mean for your
  program to be licensed GPLv2&rdquo;.</p></section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Our Community Made This Up</h3>

  <p class="fragment">The emperor's have no clothes!</p>
  <p class="fragment">Copyright wasn't designed for copyleft; copyleft is a
    hack on copyright.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Courts have hitherto never really considered these questions.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Experts in the field have real power to sway
    interpretation.</p></section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">If I were an Expert Witness</h3>

  <p class="fragment">Even though I know that Linus probably had in mind a
    specific (and very short!) list of syscalls when he wrote that
    exception&hellip;</p>
    <p class="fragment">I would consider (for example) using the /sys
    interfaces to manipulate GPIO as a form of normal syscall, precisely
    because Linux docs specifically document that as a normal way to interact
    with the feature</p>
    <p class="fragment">(while they say it's deprecated, says that the SYSFS
    ABI WILL NOT BE DEVELOPED (NO NEW FEATURES), IT WILL JUST BE
    MAINTAINED).</p></section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Layering with Weak Copyleft</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Consider libgpiod.</p>
  <p class="fragment">It provides an <em>additional</em> layer of API for
    GPIO.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Upon a quick analysis, I believe it likely uses only
    &ldquo;normal system calls&rdquo;, so the syscall exception applies to
    libgpiod itself.</p>
  <p class="fragment">libgpiod then introduces new copyrights under
    the <strong>Lesser</strong> public license.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Libgpiod?</h3>
  <p class="fragment">The derivative work analysis here is surely complex
  (and I've not yet done it).</p>
  <p class="fragment">But an outcome that said &ldquo;using libgpiod in the
  usual way requires GPLv2-only to cover the original work&rdquo; would
  flabbergast me.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">The Dual License with BSD</h3>
  <p class="fragment">I'm still a bit baffled why this tradition started.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Ostensibly it was for code sharing with the *BSD projects.</p>
  <p class="fragment">I frankly think it's being exploited by companies who
    either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">do not want to grant outbound GPLv2 licenses.</li>
    <li class="fragment">think this magically gets them around copyleft (it
      doesn't: remember, effective license of the work is GPLv2!)</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Proprietary Kernel Modules</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Simply put: I have yet to see a proprietary kernel
  module that did not create a derivative and/or combined work with Linux,
    in my (non-lawyer but) expert opinion.</p>
  <p class="fragment">There have been companies getting away with violating
  copyright licenses for many years and the resources available to stop them
    are limited.</p>
  <p class="fragment">This is why Conservancy continues to enforce the GPL
    for Linux.</p></section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">The Glib Answer To All Licensing Questions</h3>
  <p class="fragment">I've began to hint at how complex licensing analysis
    is.</p>
  <p class="fragment">The complexity only impacts you when you wish to keep
    something proprietary.</p>
  <p class="fragment">I have yet to see a licensing problem that isn't
    trivially solved with &ldquo;release everything under your favorite GPL-compatible license&rdquo;</p></section>

  <h3 class="top-title">The Whole SPDX thing</h3>
  <p class="fragment">You've probably seen Linux Foundation aggressively
    pushing SPDX identifiers into single files.</p>
  <p class="fragment">The compliance industrial complex has an obsession with
    precise file-level licensing information, even if it's not entirely accurate.</p>
</section><section>
  <h3 class="top-title">The Whole SPDX thing</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Just keep in mind, copyright statutes around the world
  talk about &ldquo;works&rdquo;, not &ldquo;files&rdquo;.  The obsession
    with getting things right in each file is just misguided.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Worst of all, SPDX refuses to list all the additional
  permissions for GPLv3 that are used in Linux (for political reasons?), so
  the SPDX information can never possible be correct in Linux, by
  design.</p></section>

  <h3 class="top-title">KESAP</h3>

  <p class="fragment">SPDX decided that this is <strong>not</strong> an
