# Who Am I?

+ Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.
     + a non-profit home for permissive and copyleft projects

+ Member of Board of Directors of the FSF
     + FSF are the authors of the GPL.
 
# In The Beginning ...

<img align=right src="pdp-10.jpg" />

+ There was a computer.

+ There were terminals.

+ There were users.

+ ... and the users had freedom.

# Ye Ol' Four Freedoms

+ to use.

+ to learn and modify for yourself.

+ to copy and share.

+ to modify and share modified versions.

# &hellip; Then Freedom Eluded Us

+ They built licensing walls.

+ By separating the software from the computer.

<p>As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. &hellip; Software is something to share &hellip; You prevent good software from being written.</p>

+ Gates convinces IBM to license rather then acquire DOS.

# RMS

+ Job at MIT's AI lab in late 1970s and early 1980s.

+ Programming their PDP-10!

+ In the Golden Age.

# MIT AI Lab: The Golden Age

 - academic computing.
 - software sharing.
 - no licenses!

# MIT AI Lab

MIT changed.

# MIT AI Lab

<cite>patents == $$$</cite>

# MIT AI Lab

<cite>spin-offs == $$$</cite>

# GNU

+ Changes the world.

+ For the user of individual computers.

+ How does it do this?

# Copy, Right?

+ Most software uses a contract EULA.

+ This doesn't work for Free Software &hellip;
     + &hellip; which needs worldwide distribution.

+ Copyright, which governs software only gets this done.

# Free Software Copyright License

+ Roughly two different types of Free Sofware licenses:
    + permissive vs. copyleft
    + both **want** software freedom.

+ Permssive licensing:
    + no legal requirement to share improvements.
    + authors usually still want it.
    + use social pressure.

+ Copyleft.
     + prevents proprietarization by power of copyright.
     + share and share alike.
     + failure to do so

# On Requirement By License

<img src="Constitution.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Social pressure *does* work &hellip;
     + &hellip; and should be used (and is), even for copylefted software.

+ GPL == Constitution of Software Freedom Land.
     + a &ldquo;written down&rdquo; embodiment of core principles.

+ GPL's a detailed implementation of the four freedoms.

# It Takes a Village

+ GPL doesn't operate on its own.

+ It's a legal framework.

+ Most people are good; they follow the spirit of the law.

+ Like most laws:
    + its spirit can be ignored.
    + it needs to be enforced.
    + it can be manipluated and abused.

# How Do You Build Community?

+ Well, you don't **build** a community.

+ One grows when the water's fine.

+ You need diversity of:
    + ideas
    + contribution
    + ownership

# GPL Corruption: MySQL

<img width="274" height="383" align=right src="marten-mickos.jpg"/>

+ Proprietary relicensing (by holding all copyright).

+ GPL enforcement with profit as its primary (and only?) goal.

+ MySQL would shake down GPL users to buy proprietary licenses they didn't need.

+ I wish I'd identified this as corruption sooner.

# How MySQL story ended?

<img align=right src="michael-rossiter-fish-eat-fish.jpg"/>

+ MySQL AB, Bought by Sun, then both by Oracle.

+ Forked by multiple communities.

+ Most thriving one doesn't require assignment to a company.

+ But it's named Drizzle.

# What's in a Name?

+ Names aren't copyrighted.
    + thus not copylefted either.

+ Trademark is legal system that governs names.

+ Often the name stays with whoever controlled it first commercially.

+ New communities form new names (e.g., Drizzle).

+ Ultimately this rarely matters.
 
# Ongoing Prescription for Health?

+ Develop in public
    + share improvements, even when you don't have to.

+ Take academic attitude about the software.
    + publishing results means publishing related software.

+
