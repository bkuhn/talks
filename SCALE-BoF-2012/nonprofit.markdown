# My Two Roles

+ President and Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ On Board of Directors of the FSF.

+ This talk's about an important thing the two orgs have in common.

# Some GNU History

<img src="rms-80s-scaled.png" align="right" />

+ GNU Manifesto, 1984.

+ RMS wrote in that *GNU Manifesto*:
      - *"All sorts of development can be funded with a Software Tax"*
      - *"People with new ideas could distribute programs as [free software], asking for donations from satisfied users"*

# Some FSF History

<img src="gnu-head.jpg" align="right" />

+ FSF is founded in 1984.

+ Gets 501(c)(3) status in 1985.

+ FSF's first 12 years is mostly to employ developers!
      - 46% of FSF's history.
      - (Source: GNU's Bulletins 1986-1997)

# FSF-Employed Developers

+ 1985-1997: FSF employs many developers:
    + Paul Rubin (GCC)
    + Jay Fenlason (awk, ld, etc)
    + Diane Barlow Close (documentation)
    + Roland McGrath (glibc, make)
    + Mike Rowan
    + Thomas Bushnell (tar, HURD)
    + Jim Blandy (Emacs, Guile)
    + Tom Lord (oleo, rx, Guile)
    + Melissa Weisshaus (documentation)
    + Lisa Goldstien (documentation)
    + Karl Heuer (Emacs)
    + Miles Bader (HURD)
    + Ian Murdock (Debian (yes, FSF funded 1st Debian (!)))

# FSF's Now a Different Kind of Org

+ GNU packages now maintained by volunteers (from FSF's view)

+ The volunteers are usually paid for by for-profits
     - Red Hat, Codesourcery, Google, IBM, etc.
     - even Canonical, Ltd (GRUB maintainer works there)

+ FSF remains a non-profit home:
    - provides oversight & ensures software freedom
    - &copy; assignment (w/ promise to keep it FaiF)

# Non-Profit vs. For-Profit

+ For-profits act in interest in shareholders.

+ 501(c)(3) Non-profits act in interest of the public good.

+ Software freedom is best when in public good.

+ Non-profit orgs (NPOs) are best place for software freedom.

# Conservancy Differs from (Modern) FSF

+ GNU is unique:
     - since it's so well-established
     - one of the oldest Free Software Projects

+ The history helps FSF keep for-profits from bad actions.

+ Other models needed for younger projects.

+ Sometimes, developers should be *funded* by non-profits,
     - to mitigate dangers of for-profit control.

# What Can NPOs Do?

+ Collect (USA-tax-deductible) donations for a project.
      - both individual and corporate.

+ Distribute that money to advance project (and public good).

+ Make sure project isn't controlled by for-profit interests.

+ Help leadership with non-technical decisions.

# Organization Proliferation

+ Too many NPOs will confuse donors.

+ Need a board of directors, incorporation, meetings, IRS filings.

+ Hackers end up doing work they hate.

+ Less Free Software gets written.

# Aggregating Under Umbrella

+ Conservancy is designed as one organization.

+ Composed of many different projects.

+ Each has its own funds.

+ One board of directors, one non-technical governance structure.

# Funding Through Conservancy 

+ Travel to conferences.

+ Handling Google SoC.

+ Conference invoicing and contracts.

+ Stipends and paid development contracts for developers.

+ Fiscal oversight.
