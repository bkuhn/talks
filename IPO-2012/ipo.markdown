# What Is a Free Software?

+ Free Software development started in earnest in mid-1980s.

+ Goal: Create software that could be shared by all without licensing fees &hellip;
     + &hellip; that gave <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">the freedoms for all users</a> to:
         + study
         + modify
         + distribute
         + distribute modified versions.

+ Ironically, Free Software is now essential to commercial, for-profit companies.

# What Is a Free Software Project?

+ Projects are made of people.

+ By that, we mean *individuals* &hellip;
     + not companies.
     + not even non-profits.

+ Developers are a mix of volunteers, academics, and employees of companies and non-profits.

# What Is a Free Software Project?

+ In essence, the group of volunteers function legally as an unincorporated non-profit.

+ They generally operate akin to a USA 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(6) non-profit.

+ Conservancy fills the need to create a non-profit home for these unincorporated communities of developers.

# How Non-Profits Help

+ A <a href="http://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=96099,00.html/">501(c)(3)</a> cannot give <a href="http://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=123297,00.html">private benefit</a> to any single individual or for-profit.

+ Must act in the interest of the general public.

+ Exactly the mindset of Free Software.

+ Provides neutral territory for other interests to meet and collaborate.

+ Software freedom is best when in public good.

# Aggregating Under Umbrella

+ <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/">Conservancy</a> is designed as one organization.

+ Composed of <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/members/current/">many different projects</a>.

+ Each has its own funds.

+ One <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/about/board/">board of directors</a>, one non-technical governance structure.

# Funding Through Conservancy 

+ Travel to conferences.

+ Handling Google SoC and other philanthropy programs.

+ Conference invoicing and contracts.

+ Stipends and paid development contracts for developers.

+ Fiscal oversight.

+ <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/members/services/">Many other services</a>.

# Assets and the Like

+ Conservancy often is the owner of the computers used for the projects.

+ Conservancy is part to any contracts/agreements.

+ And your area of interest:
      + so-called &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;


# Free Software and "IP"

>The Congress shall have Power &hellip; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries

*** 

+ Note: By IP, most developers think you mean &ldquo;Internet Protocol&rdquo;.

+ If they know term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; &hellip;
     + they probably object to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html">its fundamental bias</a> (as I do).
     + ideas aren't akin to physical property.

# Free Software and "IP"

+ When applied to software, these systems rarely function &hellip;
     + &hellip; in the manner that Free Software developers want, anyway.

+ They're actually separate, unrelated topics: trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets.

+ Conservancy has different polices on each.

+ Let's start with the one we all probably use in the same way: trademarks

# Trademarks

+ Conservancy typically files for trademarks for its projects names/logos.

+ Avoiding &ldquo;consumer confusion&rdquo; is valuable to Free Software.

+ Yet, most projects want a very liberal and open usage policy.

+ Adoption and sharing of the software is key.

+ Strict policies are met with ire
     + cf.: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation_software_rebranded_by_the_Debian_project">Iceweasel/Firefox debacle</a>

# Patents

+ Conservancy opposes all patenting of software.
     + Nearly every org in the Free Software community does.
     + See various Free Software related amici in Bilski.

+ Post-Bilski, fighting software patents seems insurmountable.
     + Generating our own software patents to fight back is cost-prohibitive.

+ Most Free Software projects invent-around, or suffer adoption failure if they can't.

+ Many of us believe the scourge that is patenting of software will ultimately devour itself in lawsuits.

# Copyrights

+ Nearly all Free Software licenses are copyright licenses.

+ Generating copyrights is what developers do all day! (i.e., they write code).

+ Much of Conservancy's work involves advising and working with issues of copyright.

+ But, Conservancy doesn't mandate developer assign copyright to Conservancy.
     + Some do anyway, though.

# Free Software Copyright Licensing

+ The Free Software Community is separated into two equally important groups:
     + The permissively licensed, who use social pressure to liberate code.
     + The copyleft licensed, whose license requires liberation.

+ Social pressure *does* work &hellip;
     + &hellip; and should be used (and is), even for copylefted software.
     + &hellip; enforcement is a last resort.

# GPL

+ GPL == Constitution of Software Freedom Land.
     + a &ldquo;written down&rdquo; embodiment of core principles.

+ Any strict rules in copyleft licenses are designed to uphold software freedom.

+ Any enforcement of the license has the primary goal of software freedom in mind.

+ Injunctions &amp; monetary compensation are (at best) a consolation prize.

# GPL Enforcement

+ Plurality of my time since 1999 has been spent on GPL enforcement.
     + I'm the key person &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for nearly every major USA GPL enforcement action.

+ I'm disturbed Harald Welte &amp; I've inspired creation of the &ldquo;compliance&rdquo; industry.

+ Ironically, &ldquo;compliance&rdquo; industry wants enforcement to seem worse than it is.

+ FUD aids their mission.

# Violations of Conservancy's Focus

+ Nearly all GPL violations are by for-profit companies.

+ Violators absolutely increase their profits by failing to comply &hellip;
     + &hellip; just like truckers who deliver faster by speeding.

+ Both *undercut* those who comply.

+ But it's still a matter of degree:
      + should speeding trucks get pulled over when they go 53 km/h in 50 zone?

# Egregious Violations

+ The primary point of any copyleft license:
    + &hellip; is to make sure source code is available.
    + &hellip; and make sure it is the *right* source code. 

+ Nearly all the violations Conservancy handles are:
     + **no-source-nor-offer**: complete disregard for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html#section3">GPLv2&sect;3</a> / <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#section6"GPLv3&sect;6</a> 
     + **offer-fail**: bogus offer for source under GPLv2&sect;3(b) / GPLv3&sect;6(b)

+ I've been doing this 13 years &amp; the &ldquo;egregious&rdquo; queue has never been near empty.

# A Radical Statement

+ Copyleft compliance isn't a legal problem &hellip;

+ &hellip; or even a &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; problem &hellip;

+ &hellip; it's an engineering problem.

+ Everything else is trivially fixed!

# The Easy Parts of Compliance

+ Fixing copyright notices.

+ Clarifying contradictory license texts.

+ Other informational requirements.

# Only Hard Part of Compliance

+ C&amp;CS: complete and corresponding source code.

+ Bulk of all enforcement time is spent on this.

+ It's hard b/c violators won't let us talk to engineers &hellip;

+ &hellip; or they don't know who they are.

+ &hellip; and the engineering problems aren't even interesting!

# Money

+ No one in non-profits is getting rich from this.

+ Who should pay for enforcement: 
     - Those who *comply* or those who *violate*?
     - Individual donors?

+ There must be a deterrent.

+ Non-profit enforcement == accountability.
    + See <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/about/filings/">Conservancy's Form 990s</a>.
+ Confidentiality is something violators ask for.

# Why Keep Doing Enforcement?

+ It's very simple:
    + an unenforced GPL **is** the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">ISC license</a>.
    + If developers prefer ISC, they will switch to it.
    + It's still Free Software; I'm not against it.

+ When no software developers are left who want to enforce GPL &hellip;
    + I'll, of course, stop.
    + Conservancy does what our developers ask us to do for their projects.

# A Brief Reminder

+ I talk extensively about enforcement because it's the most interesting thing Conservancy does.
     + Indeed, I'm almost sure it's why you invited me here today.

+ Most of what Conservancy does is *really* boring:
     + flight reimbursements for developers.
     + invoicing donors for their financial donations.
     + handling other random logistical bulls***.

+ Enforcement is just a small part of Conservancy's work.
