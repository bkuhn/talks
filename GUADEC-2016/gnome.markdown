# The Masochistic Programmer

+ Adversity overcome = experience &amp; community bonds.

+ Historically, programmers believed the challenge of even *using* software
  was significant.

+ Everyone wants:
      - an invitation to the secret club.
      - to show they've overcome adversity &amp; succeeded.
<hr/>

> Real Programmers don't comment their code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.

# Write What You Know

+ Early software authors wrote software for people like themselves.
       + Other scientists used the first computers.
       + It's, in fact, why we call them &ldquo;computers&rdquo;.

# User Culture 

<br/>

+ This sign was on the wall in the processing department (main computer users
on site) at my first job in 1991.

# In Service of Users?

+ The advent of the &ldquo;user&rdquo;:
       + What, like a drug user (abuser)?
       + Or a someone who manipulates you into action you didn't want to do?

# Users are People

+ (Don Norman)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgJcUHC3qJ8].

+ Have confidence: they are people, not users.

# Fear of Failure

+ The most comfortable role in life is to create things that satisfy yourself. 
      - &amp; it makes it easiest to succeed.

+ Developers that loved the first computer they used:
     - will spend their careers writing &amp; using software much like that.

# Why I Hate GUIs: Reason 0.

+ I wrote exactly three GUI programs in my life.
     - all of them were for schoolwork.
     - I doubt I'll try one again.

+ If I'm honest, I hate GUIs because I haven't the skill to write a good one.

+ I'm in awe of those that can, because they write what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; *people* want.

# Why I Hate GUIs: Reason 1.

+ Everyone hates change, unless it's their idea.

+ Agents of change have both a burden &amp; a power over others.

+ The best agents of change are those that:
    - seek change that uses the power to relinquish that power.
    - convince others to see that over the horizon on the bumpy road ahead lies something better.

# Meine Brille

# Meine Brille

+ Hier ist der Bradley.  Er trägt eine Brille.  Eine Brille von 2003.

<img src="bkuhn-2007.jpg" align="center"  />

# Meine Brille

+ Im 2010 (auf GUADEC 2010), die gleiche Brille.

<img src="bkuhn-guadec-2010.jpg" width="571" height="428" align="center"  />

# Meine Brille

+ Im 2016, (auf LCA 2010) die gleiche Brille.

<img src="bkuhn-lca-2016.jpg" width="640" height="670" align="center"  />

# Meine Brille

+ Im 2016, (auf LCA 2010) die gleiche Brille, jetzt kaputt.

<img src="bkuhn-lca-2016-glasses-zoom.jpg" align="center"  />

# Meine Neue Brille

+ The *other* side broke last week.

+ After 13 years, I had to give in.
      + But the viewing area is better.
      + They're actually lighter.

+ OTOH, they hurt my nose, the back of my ears, etc.

# Meine Neue Brille as GNOME 3

+ On Tuesday, the optician put a lot of effort into adjusting them to my complaints.

+ She was incredibly patient &amp; kind &mdash; but firm.

+ She finally said: &ldquo;They will stop hurting as soon as you stop thinking about them.&rdquo;

+ We should have hired her to do Linus' &ldquo;fitting&rdquo; for his  GNOME 3 desktop.

+ So, I changed glasses' frames, but *I'm* still not going to change desktops:

# My Desktop

<img src="bkuhn-screenshot.png" width="640" height="480" align="center"  />

# My Desktop

+ Yes, it works for me.

+ I work faster at a computer than most people I know.

+ But this is software designed for people like me.
      - when it comes to making use of a computer &hellip;
      - *most people in the world are not like me*!

# My Wife's Desktop

<br/>

<img src="keever-screenshot.png" width="640" height="400" align="center"  />

# How I Use my Wife's Desktop

+ So, I don't really need GNOME &hellip;
     - &hellip; there are faster ways to open a terminal &hellip; 
     - &amp; besides, I still prefer xterm, not gnome-terminal.

<img src="keever-screenshot-bkuhn.png" width="640" height="400" align="center"  />

# But We All Need It

<hr/>

Jonathan Blandford put it best to me circa 2003 (paraphrase from my memory):

<hr/>

> I got involved with GNOME for one simple reason.  I want to help make a
> Free Software desktop, because everyone needs it.

# What About Software Freedom?

+ Computing should be for everyone.
       + and everyone deserves software freedom. 

+ &amp; it's not to turn everyone into programmers.

+ It's to *find* the programmers, generationally.
       + The new developers are those users who are inspired to tinker.
       + They won't be found if their software is proprietary.

+ We cannot and should not assume that all potential software developers are
  heterogeneously like the current generation.


# The (Former) Competition

<img src="Windows_95_at_first_run.png"  align="center"  />

# Early Success was "Made of Easy"

+ Microsoft, as an opponent, was never actually user-driven.
       + They, quite loudly, cared about &ldquo;developers, developers, developers&rdquo;.

+ Matching &amp; defeating Microsoft on the desktop was a relatively easy
  task &mdash; albeit time consuming.

# The Rising Threat

<img src="apple-logo.svg"  align="right"  />

+ Two Months After GUADEC 4 (Dublin), I went to LinuxWorld Expo 2003.

+ Overheard on the escalator:

+ &ldquo;I think I'm going to ditch my Linux laptop for Mac soon.  I really like OS X.&rdquo;


# The Other Devices?

+ 5 years ago, I had lunch with a major former GNOME community member &amp; a
  major GNU/Linux server application developer.
      + Both said: &ldquo;in five years, everyone will be using tablets and phones,
        the keyboard and desktop are on the way out.&rdquo;

+ &amp; traditional computer sales trended downward from 2010 to 2015 (US
  data): 93 million to 71.25 million (source: Gartner)
       + but that's still 71.25 million *new* computers sold.

+ And Apple is taking that over.

# Mac Laptops Might Win

+ Mac laptop sales are trending to overtake all the non-Mac sales.

+ *That* is the fight we need to chase, because:
      + Mac's proprietariness makes traditional Microsoft look Free Software friendly.
      + non Free Software geeks *like* Macs.
      + Someone will dominate the laptop market; it should be Free Software.

# Software Freedom In Our Lifetimes?

+ Spoiler alert: Software freedom won't win our lifetimes.

+ But it's not about winning.
      + We don't need &ldquo;Year of the Linux Desktop&rdquo;.
      + We just need every year to be &ldquo;Year that Free Software desktop usage
        grew slightly&rdquo;.

+ In other words, We've always thought about this all wrong.
      + we don't have to win; we simply must keep playing to stalemate.

+ It's admittedly painful to pursue the morally right alternative when so many
  seems against you.

# Wily Opponents

+ Apple has smart people working there.


<hr/>
> Prime Minister: &ldquo;But you're wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out &mdash; well &mdash; anything!&rdquo;<br/>
> Minister for Magic: &ldquo;The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.&rdquo;

# We're Wily Opposition

+ But GNOME 3 did something special; just like the Mac.

+ Don't forget that, and let it sustain you: you're all wizards too.

# Why Andy Came To Us

<img src="andyhertzfeld.jpg"  width="360" height="207" align="right"  />

+ Andy Hertzfeld designed most of the original Mac operating system.

+ But he came to our community &amp; hung out for about five years.
      + We wouldn't have Nautilus without [Eazel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eazel).

+ We've sometimes inspired the sharpest minds from the proprietary UX world.
      + &amp; we'll do it again if we keep doing good work.

# Adversarial Life Is Challenging

+ I give a lot of talks lately about Open Source cooption.

+ There's tremendous financial pressure to work on
  non-copyleft, non-user-facing code.
      + OpenStack, IaaS, PaaS, etc.
      + Watch my [2015](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2015/dec/12/yir-bkuhn-lca/) and [2016](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2016/aug/04/lca-2016/) LCA talks for more details.

+ TL;DR for this audience: The incumbent power structure doesn't care if software freedom on the desktop goes away.

+ We're in for a long fight.

+ So, how do we keep going?

# What Shakira &amp; RMS have in common

# My Plane Ride Here

<img align="right" height="327" width="451" src="cry-planes.png"/>

+ I promised I'd work on my talk.
     + But I decided to watch a movie.

+ So, I usually pick the sappiest new release I can find.
     + And simply embrace the crying on planes thing.
     + So I watched *Zootopia*.
     
# Shakira's lyrics

<br/>

> I won't give up, no I won't give in<br/>
> Till I reach the end, then I'll start again<br/>
> No I won't leave, I wanna try everything <br/>
> I wanna try even though I could fail<br/>
> I won't give up, no I won't give in

# Just Keep Going!

+ I'd love to tell you everything is awesome.

+ I'd love to say the struggle for software freedom will be made of easy.
       + (Yes, that's my second &ldquo;made of easy&rdquo; joke; sorry.)

+ It won't be easy, but the future of software freedom *needs* an innovative GPL'd desktop.

+ Please, keep making it better.  Even though I'm not going to use it.  I still need it.

+ *We* still need it.
