# Am I Qualified to Give This Talk?

+ I am not a political scientist.

+ I am not a sociologist.

+ I am (to use a phrase that admittedly I coined):
     - **an accidental politician**.

# What Is Politics?

<span class="fitonslide">

Politics (from Greek: πολιτικός (politikos): "of, for, or relating to
citizens") is the process of making uniform decisions applying to all members
of a group. It also involves the use of power by one person to affect the
behavior of another person. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and
exercising positions of governance &mdash; organized control over a human
community.

# Key Issues of Software Freedom Politics

<span class="fitonslide">

Politics is the process of making **uniform decisions applying to all members**
of a group. It also involves the **use of power** by one person **to affect the
behavior of another** person. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and
exercising **positions of governance** &mdash; organized control over a human
community.

# How Did This Begin?

+ Software freedom has roughly two roots:
     - CS academics: the BSD project and its descendants.
     - activist: the GNU project and its descendants.

+ Neither was terribly political to start:
     - even the activism.

+ It started slowly:
     - politicians arrived &hellip;
     - &ldquo;spin&rdquo; began &hellip;
     - &ldquo;duc, sequere, aut de via decede&rdquo; (&ldquo;lead, follow, or get out of the way&rdquo;)

# First Mover's Advantage

+ Tim O'Reilly should be credited as the first Open Source politician.

+ He organized the so-called [historical Palo Alto meeting](https://opensource.org/history) in early 1998.

+ An [invite-only event under O'Reilly's control](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/pr/796).

+ 14 un-elected, affluent men (all but one Caucasian) in a room **decide** what
  the principles of a whole community are.

+ This is where &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo; comes from.

# A Uniform Decision

<span class="fitonslide">

Politics &hellip; is the process of making **uniform decisions applying to all
members** of a group.

# On Terminology

+ The early political opposition to this was, IMO, correct but clumsy.

+ RMS, founder of the GNU project, writes
  [*Why Open  Source Misses The Point*](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html).

+ The debate as framed as a terminology battle rather than a question of cooption.

# Cooption

**Co-option** (n.):

The process by which a group subsumes or assimilates a smaller or weaker
group with related interests; or, similarly, the process by which one group
gains converts from another group by attempting to replicate the aspects that
they find appealing without adopting the full program or ideals.

# O'Reilly Hustles The Meme

<hr/>

> The meeting's purpose was to facilitate a high-level discussion of the
> successes and challenges facing the **developers**. While this type of software
> has often been called &hellip; &ldquo;free software&rdquo; in the past,
> the developers agreed that commercial development of the software is part
> of the picture, and that the term &hellip; &ldquo;open source&rdquo;
> &hellip; best describes the **development method they support**.

 &mdash; <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/pr/796">O'Reilly and Associates

# The Meme Hustler

+ O'Reilly may be the best politician Open Source has ever seen.

+ [see Evgeny Morozov's article, *The Meme Hustler*](http://thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler)

+ Seeing ahead to what those in power will want to coopt &hellip;
     - &amp; priming it to adapt it for their cooption.
     - &amp; is a wonderful way to gain power.

+ c.f. John L. O'Sullivan and [&ldquo;manifest destiny&rdquo;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny)

# Why Focus on O'Reilly?

+ He's surely the most successful &amp; savvy Open Source politician.

+ &amp; his play didn't end with the Open Source cooption.

# Freedom 0

+ In 2001, Microsoft begins attacking copyleft, specifically.
    - Their political goal: bifurcate the copyleft/non-copyleft segments of community.
    - Encourage more non-copyleft projects.
    - With help, they succeeded.

+ O'Reilly's messaging is much better:
    - Freedom 0, he says, is &ldquo;the freedom to chose your own license&rdquo;.

# Politics of Power

<span class="fitonslide">

Politics &hellip; involves the **use of power** by one person **to affect the
behavior of another** person.

# Freedom or Power?

+ In 2001, I [co-wrote an essay with RMS, called *Freedom or Power*](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.en.html).

+ It was basically in response to O'Reilly's Freedom 0
      - although, we scrubbed that reference in the final version &hellip;
      - in an effort to control the meme.

+ Ultimately, where does the power in FLOSS (Free, Libre and Open Source Software) come from?

# Why We're Obsessed With Licenses

+ There's really only one monopolistic control mechanism for software:
      - copyright

+ Audrey Eschright: copyright is the &ldquo;primary point of leverage&rdquo;.

+ If you hold the exclusive decision-making about copyright, you wield all the power.

+ O'Reilly wasn't talking about freedom, he was talking about power.
      - control the copyright &rightarrow; control the power &rightarrow; win
        the politics &rightarrow; govern.


# Controlling Governance

<span class="fitonslide">

Politics &hellip; refers to achieving and exercising **positions of
governance** &mdash; organized control over a human community.

<p align="right">
 &mdash; <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Politics&oldid=726465991">Politics. (2016,

 2016.  (Emphasis mine)
</p>
</span>

# The Buzzword of Governance

+ This phrase itself is used with vastly different meanings in FLOSS.

+ Governance in FLOSS circles can mean:
      - what licensing your project requires for upstreaming (rarely means that anymore).
      - how technical decisions are made.
      - how **companies** exploit FLOSS (particularly what licenses they **ban**).

+ Who is in charge of governance?

# Unelected Incumbent Power Structure

+ The advent of the for-profit corporate &ldquo;Open Source office&rdquo;.

+ Ostensibly, their mission is to manage interaction with FLOSS.
      - BTW, isn't &ldquo;community management&rdquo; a NewSpeak sort of phrase?

+ Really, these are the incumbent leadership.
      - Many of them were once FLOSS activists.
      - Some of them still model their roles as such.
      - But they are inside the for-profit corporate system.

# Unelected Incumbent Power Structure

+ Their tactic mission:
      - Exploit volunteer labor for the Company.
      - Control policy, procedures and the ultimate power structure of FLOSS.

# Really, Be Obsessed with Licensing

+ The power structure is, again, who controls the copyrights.

+ Companies promulgate CLAs &copy;AAs.
       - the goal of such agreements is to give **all the power** to the Company.

+ Turn FLOSS contribution into a one-click-through omnibus, rights-shifting
  agreement only Apple or Facebook could love.

+ The so-called &ldquo;Post Open Source&rdquo; no-licensing meme is in
  service of that messaging.

# Astroturfing

**Astroturfing** (n.):

the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g.,
political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as
though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participant(s).

# The Trade Association Model

+ Organize for-profit-controlled trade associations
       - 501(c)(6) in the USA.

+ Give minimal funding to specific FLOSS projects with broad base of
  supporter.
       - create good will; it's their marketing budget.

+ Use that brand to gain interest, more resources, &amp; developer mindshare.

+ Long-term: this changes the focus of work.

# The Paradox

<span class="fitonslide">

For some time now, this paradoxical principle appears to hold: *each day*,
more lines of freely licensed code exist than ever before in human history;
yet, it also becomes increasingly more difficult *each day* for users to
successfully avoid proprietary software while completing their necessary work
on a computer.  </span>

# The New Cooptive Meme: Sustainability

+ These new would-be O'Reilly's today seek to brand sustainability as:
       - Control the goose that lays the golden eggs. 
       - They want the Open Source gravy train to keep running.
       - They even attempted to reinvent that invite-only meeting from 1998
         earlier this year!

+ Audrey Eschright's framing is right:
       - Create an environment that assures **users** have essential freedoms,
         and **individual** developers can create systems that treat those
         users well.

# Why You Should Care?

+ First: it seems no one is studying this sociopolitical structure.
       - perhaps the papers belong with political scientists?

+ Second: the FLOSS world that you study is in danger of crumbling.
       - Open Source done this was is not particularly distinct from
         existing traditional proprietary methods.
       - well, perhaps our collapse will make a good paper someday.

+ Third: will it hit the other collaborative communities?

# Wikipedia

+ Jimmy Wales specifically cited Free Software as the primary inspiration for
  starting Wikipedia.

+ Wikipedia's organizational principles were congruent with software freedom.


+ Wikimedia Foundation embodied them.

# Wikimedia

+ 2016 &ldquo;search engine debacle&rdquo; shows overly powerful organizations.
       - Fortunately, existence as a charity where volunteers have real power
         (rather than a trade association), likely saved it.

+ Wikipedia could succeed in collaborative &amp;
  egalitarian political organization because of the project's nature.
       - A single encyclopedia hosted on a single website has cohesion we
         can't create in the anarchy of Free Software.
       - &amp; we've left power vacuums that leave us open to cooption.

# Wikimedia

+ Sure, they've had their scandals.

+ But, it's tough to say anything really bad about Wikimedia:
       - they're a charity.
       - they insist on only free-as-in-freedom licensing.
       - they have egalitarian, republican governance.

# Those Who Forget the Past...

+ Software freedom spawned the Open.* communities.
       - they are repeating the mistakes that we made. 

+ For me, it's like watching a *very* slow motion car crash.

# Licensing Challenges

+ Creative Commons absolutely refuses to take a moral stance.
       - ND &amp; NC licensing, which Open Source and Free Software
         eradicated 20 years ago, is *often preferred*.

+ copyleft (CC BY-SA or GPL) is widely rejected in Open.* communities.
       - e.g., Adam, speaking from Open Education, lambasted copyleft
         this morning.
       - yet copyleft is the only system to assure for-profit companies don't
         exploit without giving back.

# Rejection of Software Freedom

+ Open.* communities widely reject software freedom.
       - the vehement anti-copyleft rhetoric is just the beginning.
       - On one point, Adam &amp; I agree: &ldquo;Why are Open Education people
         not doing Open Source?&rdquo;

+ But, even some software-liberated initiatives don't support Free Software
  operating systems like GNU/Linux &amp; FreeBSD.

+ These position are often utilized by the cooptive forces in the software
  world to marginalize radical positions.

# What Can You Do?

+ Academic research *is* political by its nature.
       - I know of researchers who are funded to produce data to discredit
         activist positions.

+ Who funds the research matters:
       - (cf: where we're standing: Fraunhofer's patents are regularly used
         to attack Free Software projects.)

+ Be as independent as possible.

+ You're not anthropologists so you can occasionally &ldquo;go native&rdquo;
       - teach your students that there is a moral &amp; activist component
         to this work.
