# My History

+ In a CS PhD program at University of Cincinnati (1997-2000).

+ Dropped out with a Master's to do policy work for Free Software Foundation.

+ Worked at various non-profits.

+ Now work at a fiscal sponsor non-profit, called Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ I'm not a researcher; I'm a policy wonk &amp; advocate for software freedom.

# In The Beginning ...

<img align=right src="pdp-10.jpg" />

+ There was a computer.

+ There were terminals.

+ There were users.

+ ... and the users had freedom.

# Ye Ol' Four Freedoms

+ to use.

+ to learn and modify for yourself.

+ to copy and share.

+ to modify and share modified versions.

# The Golden Age of Computing

<img src="pdp-10-2.jpg" align="right"  />

 - academic computing.
 - software sharing.
 - no licenses!

# BSD Project

+ 1974: AT&amp;T gives University of California Berkeley full Unix source.

+ BSD releases its own distribution.

+ No one worries about the licensing, until &hellip;


# &hellip; Then Freedom Eluded Us

+ They built licensing walls.

+ By separating the software from the computer.

+ Who Invented Licensing?

# Who Invented Licensing?
<br/>
Some think he did:
<br/>
<img src="bill-gates-arrest.jpg" align="left"  />
<p>As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. 
&hellip; [If] software is something to share &hellip; You prevent good software from being written.</p>

<br clear="all"/>

+ Gates convinces IBM to license rather than acquire DOS.

# BSD Lawsuit

+ AT&amp;T monopoly gone: 1987 break-up.

+ Unix copyrights end up with USL.

+ They sue UC-Berkeley in 1992.

+ Unresolved until mid 1990s
        + Legal BSD release left incomplete system.
        + Took years for BSD to work again.

+ BSD only barely recovered.

# The Rise of Copyleft

# RMS

<img align=right src="rms-book-cover.jpg"  />

+ Job at MIT's AI lab in late 1970s and early 1980s.

+ Programming their PDP-10!

+ In the Golden Age.

# GNU Project

<img src="gnu-head.jpg" align="right" />

+ RMS founds GNU project: copyleft licensing.

+ Founded on idealism.

+ Recruited volunteers.

+ Paid non-profit staff.

+ Centered around MIT.

# MIT AI Lab

<img src="ai-lab-tear-down.jpg" align="right"  />

But MIT was changing.

# MIT AI Lab

<cite>patents == $$$</cite>

# MIT AI Lab

<cite>spin-offs == $$$</cite>

# Academic Patent Licensing

+ MIT gets USA Patent 4,405,829 on RSA.

+ USA is first to invent (until 2011).

+ MIT launches spin-off: RSA Data Security.

+ Sets back adoption of public key cryptography.

# The Cycle

+ Government funds research.

+ Universities gain patents &amp; copyrights.

+ Universities launch spin-offs.

+ Universities get money.  

# Unintended consequences?

<img src="shuttleworth-spacesuit.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Ever wonder why he's so wealthy?

# Selling from outside the USA.

+ RSA was published in 1977; patented years later.

+ Few places are "first to invent".
       + Patent applies only in a few countries.

+ Shuttleworth sells RSA certificates back to USA cheaply.
       + Undercuts Network Solutions.

+ Why did we let that wealth leave USA for South Africa? 

# My Own Master's Thesis

+ University of Cincinnati Copyright Policy says:
       + Graduate students hold copyright on their thesis document.
       + But not on your software!

+ Hired a lawyer, but couldn't get University lawyers to budge.

+ So, I put my source code as an appendix to my thesis document.

+ &hellip; and released it as Free Software.

# How Collaboration Should Work.

+ Academic system should be released in software freedom.

+ The four freedoms are **designed** for academic exploration.

+ Yet, universities function like businesses.

+ We should be agents of change on this issue.

# The Irony of Business Research

<img src="lab-rat.jpg" align="right"  />

+ FLOSS community has become a favorite research target.
        + Business schools
        + Anthropologists
        + Sociologists

+ I've been a lab rat in four different studies.

+ No real objection, but I'd rather researchers would &ldquo;go native&rdquo;.

# Research from the CS-side

+ So many research systems are released as proprietary software.

+ The paper is king: what about the software?

+ Even systems without commercial viability are kept proprietary.

+ NSF funding shouldn't go toward proprietary software.

# Technology Transfer

<img src="CACM-cover-1996-09.jpg" align="right"  />

+ A perennial issue for academic CS research.

+ Corporate spin-offs is not **charitable** technology transfer.
      + I question if Universities are fulfilling their 501(c)(3) missions with it.
      + IRS legality is an &ldquo;open question&rdquo;. [Milton2010]

+ Obama's Jobs Council says: &ldquo;the Administration should test an &lsquo;open-source&rsquo; approach to tech transfer and commercialization.&ldquo; [JobsCouncil2011]

+ Academia can take the lead here.

# Haskell

+ Haskell wasn't merely an academic language:

+ University of Glasgow released implementation as Free Software.

+ Many contributors and industry interest.

+ Now some standard Free Software programming language.

+ Reference: [Hudak2007]

# What Your Students Need.

+ Linux-based systems are everywhere.

+ So many other FLOSS systems are standard.

+ Your students need to know how to contribute.

+ FLOSS contribution should be a standard course:
      + Just like Software Engineering or Algorithms.

# How NGOs Can Help?

+ FLOSS communities are notoriously difficult to engage with.

+ Purely industry-centered &ldquo;communities&rdquo; are common.
      + But designed merely as a trade associations.

+ What's the space in-between academia &amp; industry in FLOSS:
      + The FLOSS 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations.
      + (Same tax status as Universities).

# What's Conservancy Do?

+ Project communities join.

+ Become part of the org (as if they'd incorporated a non-profit).

+ Conservancy handles grants, donations, legal issues.
       + anything other than coding that needs done.

+ Becomes a center-point for collaboration &amp; communication with project.
