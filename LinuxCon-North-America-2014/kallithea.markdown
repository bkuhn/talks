# GPL Violations Differ

+ Most of my talks historically have focused on embedded Linux-based GPL violations.
      + These are the most prevalent &amp; insidious.

+ However, GPL violations come in all shapes and sizes.

+ This is the story of a different sort of violation &hellip;
      + &hellip;  which allowed for a different sort of resolution.

# What's a GPL Violation?

+ This point may be too remedial for some of you.
     + If so, take a 2 minute email break.

+ GPL (both v2 and v3) require:
     + The whole work licensed under GPL.
     + Complete, Corresponding Source (CCS) of that work provided, under GPL.

+ I could give a whole talk on any of these topics:
     + What constitutes the &ldquo;whole work&rdquo;.
     + CCS requirements of GPL.

+ If you're new to GPL enforcement, just assume for this talk:
     + There are requirements on the forms of source-code disclosures. 
     + Everyone has an opinion on the &ldquo;whole/combined work&rdquo;
       question &hellip;
     + &hellip; but there is limited statutory guidance or Court precedent on the topic.
