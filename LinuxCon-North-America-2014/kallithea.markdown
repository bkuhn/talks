% Fork and Ignore: Fighting a GPL Violation By Coding Instead

# GPL Violations Differ

+ Most of my talks historically have focused on embedded Linux-based GPL violations.
      + These are the most prevalent &amp; insidious.

+ However, GPL violations come in all shapes and sizes.

+ This is the story of a different sort of violation &hellip;
      + &hellip;  which allowed for a different sort of resolution.

# What's a GPL Violation?

+ This point may be too remedial for some of you.
     + If so, take a 2 minute email break.

+ GPL (both v2 and v3) require:
     + The whole work licensed under GPL.
     + Complete, Corresponding Source (CCS) of that work provided, under GPL.

# What's a GPL Violation?

+ I could give a whole talk on any of these topics:
     + What constitutes the &ldquo;whole work&rdquo;.
     + CCS requirements of GPL.

+ If you're new to GPL enforcement, just assume for this talk:
     + There are requirements on the forms of source-code disclosures. 
     + Everyone has an opinion on the &ldquo;whole/combined work&rdquo;
       question &hellip;
     + &hellip; but there is limited statutory guidance or Court precedent on the topic.

# Fundamental Assumptions

<img align="right" src="breaking-bad_how-much-is-enough_scaled.jpg" width="600" height="338"/>

+ Generally speaking, everyone assumes:
     + proprietary software is more lucrative than Free Software.

+ The veracity of this claim is immaterial.
     + only the perception that it's true matters.

+ Companies therefore try to keep as much proprietary as they can.

# Fundamental Assumptions

+ Most developers, left to their own devices, share their code.

+ They tend to share their code if it's convenient.
     + &amp; even sometimes when it's not so convenient.

+ That's not to say most developers are software freedom zealots like me.

+ Rather, they err on the side of code-sharing.
     + In current times, that means developers  by default release code early
       and often under a Free Software license.

+ Thus, under these assumptions, so begins our story &hellip;


# A Developer Releases a Codebase

+ The story starts like most Free Software stories:
     + In 2010-10, a developer saw some useful proprietary software &hellip;
     + &hellip; didn't like the existing Free Software alternatives &hellip;
     + &hellip; and started writing one.

+ Specifically, in June 2010:
     + GitHub was (still is) a proprietary solution &amp; only supports Git.
     + Phabricator wasn't released yet.
     + GitLab didn't exist yet (doesn't support Mercurial anyway).

+ Thus, [hg-app is announced](http://markmail.org/message/dx2pwuvt2l7u4tpn) on
  2010-06-03 under an [MIT-permissive license](https://kallithea-scm.org/repos/kallithea/files/bad9ccac26b7f84d8b7c65098ccfd6cd1903d4fe/LICENSE) on Mercurial's mailing list.

# There's Always A Flame War.

<img align="right" src="flame-war-exit.jpg" width="420" height="315"/>

+ A debate erupts about GPL compatible licensing.

+ hg-app incorporates code from Mercurial:
      + Thus, in the view of most people, hg-app is based on Mercurial (in
        the copyright &amp; GPL sense).

+ Some point out that [MIT-permissive license is GPL-compatible](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#X11License).

+ The developer decides to avoid confusion and [relicenses hg-app under GPL](http://markmail.org/message/bds5x3ebnryzypkc).

# &hellip; &amp; the Community Goes On.

+ The project is renamed to [RhodeCode](http://markmail.org/message/qg545yaqqbbh3xxy).

+ Developers from Mercurial community begin contributing under GPL.

+ Independent contracts for software improvement are available for some.

+ All is well as a traditional Free Software community, until &hellip;

# Altering The Deal

<img align="right" src="vader-altered-the-deal.jpg" width="482" height="330"/>

+ RhodeCode's primary author forms a company, RhodeCode GmbH (The Company).

+ The Company announces future versions of RhodeCode won't be GPL'd.
      + adds a &ldquo;20 user max&rdquo; code.

+ Community backlash, and threats from all sides.
      + Author of the patch that removes the 20 user max [is attacked](https://github.com/moparisthebest/unlimit-code).

# Conservancy as Mediator

+ Conservancy is contacted since Mercurial is a member project.
      + &amp; RhodeCode's codebase is based on GPL'd Mercurial code.

+ Some Mercurial developers and other community members seek aggressive enforcement action.

+ Conservancy seeks calm conversation with the Company.

+ The Company makes it clear that they believe it's 100% their copyright.

+ Situation quickly becomes a stand-off. 

# Of Course, GPL Is Irrevocable!

+ Of course, old code cannot be un-GPL'd.
      + AFAIK, no one has legitimately disputed that.

+ The question is with regard to future copyrights generated by the Company:
      + Can they relicense their *future* copyrighted works under non-GPL
        terms?

+ It's complicated:

<hr/>
>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
<span class="fitonslide">
<p align=right>  &mdash;  GPLv3&sect;2&para;1

</p>
</span>

# &ldquo;Based on&rdquo; the earlier work

+ This codebase is, in Conservancy's view, GPL'd:
     + first, it's based Mercurial.
     + second, some third-party authors contributed patches under GPL.

+ The Company just doesn't agree.

+ Friendly negotiations to reach a fully GPL'd version going further failed.

+ So what are the options?

# How This Differs from Other Violations

+ Many GPL enforcement efforts reach the point of fundamental legal
  disagreement about the requirements of GPL.

+ In most cases, the stand-off is a true stand-off:
     + Free Software community doesn't have necessary CCS for the product.
     + A lawsuit eventually becomes only remaining way to compel CCS release.

+ But we don't have a mundane violation here.

# Early Friendliness Yields Better Options

+ Ultimately, the Company was, at one point, a good actor:
     + They shared kindly their software under the irrevocable GPL.

+ That code release remains GPL'd and useful.

+ In the worst case, forking at that point is an option.
     + &amp; avoids conflict.

# Avoiding Conflict

+ Conservancy has done GPL litigation before.

+ The reason a lawsuit is the last resort: it takes far too long.

+ When licensing of the primary codebase remains uncertain during the case:
     + you've effectively repeated USL v. BSDi, and tied your codebase up in
       court for years.

+ Conservancy had better options here, thanks to earlier GPL release &hellip;
     + &hellip; plus partial release of more recent code under GPL.
 
# A Complex License

+ The Company's final text of [their license](https://rhodecode.com/licenses)
  is clearly ambiguous (or worse):

+ GPLv3, in fact, contemplated this problem:

<hr/>
<span class="fitonslide">
<p>
RhodeCode system is split-licensed and comprised of two parts:<br/><br/>
(1) The Python code and integrated HTML are licensed under the GPLv3 license as is RhodeCode itself. &hellip;<br/><br/>
(2) All other parts of RhodeCode including, but not limited to, CSS code, images, and design are licensed according to the license purchased.
</p>
</span>
 
# Invalid Additional Term?

<br/>

>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.
<span class="fitonslide">
<p align=right>&mdash;  GPLv3&sect;7&para;4</p>
</span>

# Remember: No Conflict!

+ Obviously, the Company would fight Conservancy's GPLv3&sect;7&para;4 claim.

+ Instead, to make peace, Conservancy reads the license more conservatively
  than necessary.

<hr/>
<span class="fitonslide">
<p>
RhodeCode system is split-licensed and comprised of two parts:<br/><br/>
(1) The Python code and integrated HTML are licensed under the GPLv3 license as is RhodeCode itself. &hellip;<br/><br/>
(2) All other parts of RhodeCode including, but not limited to, CSS code, images, and design are licensed according to the license purchased.
</p>
</span>

# Making the Fork

+ Thus begins: the hard work of a four step process:
      + Find the last known version of the codebase without the new (invalid) text added.
      + Extract useful patches of only Python code and HTML files from
        post-license-change versions.
      + Rebrand to a new name.
      + Ensure &ldquo;beyond reproach&rdquo; compliance.


# Step 0: Last Known GPLv3'd version

+ First step was easier than it looked.

+ Public development had stopped completely when the controversy started:
       + i.e., the project became &ldquo;throw it over the wall&rdquo;

+ The last released Mercurial repository was basically what we sought.

# Step 1: Extract New Python &amp; HTML

+ Even with hyper-conservative reading, Python code &amp; HTML are clearly GPLv3'd.

+ Careful extraction was required to include only those changes.

+ We wrote a shell script to rerun mercurial commands and verified resulting
  repositories included only new changes to Python &amp; HTML files.

# Step 3: Rename

+ Won't use the (potentially trademarked) brand name, &ldquo;RhodeCode&rdquo;
     + &hellip; other than in those ways third parties are already permitted to do so.

+ Picking names is always hard.
     + We decided on: &ldquo;Kallithea&rdquo;

<hr/>

> Kallithea is the name of a locality on the island of Rhodes, in Greece, which itself means &lsquo;the best view&rsquo;. Our Kallithea project helps developers get the best views of their project and its contributions so they can better collaborate together.

# Step 3: Rename

+ Problem: rhodecode_ was commonly used throughout the code.

+ Hyper-conservative approach requires removal.
     + This is of course mostly functional use, so perhaps unnecessary.

+ Obvious sed/perl scripts require care:
     + You have to make sure your replacements generate working code!

#  Step 4: Beyond Reproach

+ Even if upstream violated the GPLv3, it doesn't mean we have permission to
  do so.

+ Therefore, getting CCS right is a complicated issue.

+ But why?

# GPL'd Javascript

+ Most people don't realize how similar Javascript programs are to mundane
  software distribution:
      + You publish a .js file on a URL.
      + Your users download it with an HTTP request.
      + You've *distributed* (in GPLv3 terms, *conveyed*) the software to
        them.

+ Every GPL requirement, including those relating to CCS provisioning *apply*
  fully for most Javascript in a GPL'd system!

# So, What Do I find?

So, there's Javascript in this thing?

       Update CodeMirror CSS and Javascript files to version 3.15, under MIT-permissive license.

       These files are exactly as they appear the upstream release 3.15 of
       Codemirror, which was released under an MIT-permissive license.  To extract
       these files, I did the following:

       I downloaded the following file:
            http://codemirror.net/codemirror-3.15.zip
       with sha256sum of:
       $ sha256sum codemirror-3.15.zip
       8cf3a512899852fd4e3833423ea98d34918cbf7ee0e4e0b13f8b5e7b083f21b9  codemirror-3.15.zip

       And extracted from it the Javascript and CSS files herein committed, which
       are licensed under the MIT-permissive license, placing them into their
       locations in: rhodecode/public/{css,js}/

       Using the procedure above, the only difference found between these files in
       RhodeCode 2.2.5 release and herein were a few comments and whitespace.

       Note that the file .../public/js/mode/meta_ext.js does *not* appear to be
       part of CodeMirror and therefore is not included in this commit.

# Lessons for New Communities

<img align="right" src="stan-learned-something.jpg" width="224" height="316"/>

+ For a web application, *don't* just copy Javascript (even Free Software
  stuff) into your repository.

+ When you start contributing to a project, *ask* who holds domain name
  &amp; trademark for the project.
       + If the answer is one person or I don't know, find a non-profit like
         Conservancy to help *right away*.

+ Keep your own copyrights &amp; make it clear you expect the license to be
  upheld.
       + &amp; will do so yourself if needed.
