  <h2 class="top-title">FLOSS Is Now Everywhere</h2>

  <p class="fragment">15 years ago, Free, Libre and Open Source Software
  (FLOSS) advocates would come to an event like this
  to <em>convince</em> you to adopt such software.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">FLOSS Is Now Everywhere</h2>

  <p class="fragment">FLOSS is probably already in most of your products (if
  you a product seller) or in your data center (if you build your own).</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">FLOSS Is Now Everywhere</h2>
  <p class="fragment">On balance, it's a good thing that FLOSS is everywhere.</p>
  <p class="fragment">&hellip; but any fad has its downsides.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Downsides to FLOSS Popularity?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">The secondary FLOSS service market, ostensibly
  available to help companies &ldquo;manage&rdquo; (inexplicably called
  &ldquo;governance&rdquo; by such service providers) FLOSS intake and
    output.</p>
  <p><span class="fragment">I've dubbed this industry
      the</span> <strong class="fragment">compliance industrial
      complex.</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">You Deserve Such Education both FaiP &amp;FaiF </h2>
  <p class="fragment">People who really are dedicated to FLOSS do want to
  get paid for their work&hellip;</p>
  <p class="fragment">&hellip; but none of us think you should have to buy an
  expensive third-party &ldquo;code scan&rdquo; just to figure out your own
    FLOSS usage.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">What's the Real Goal?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Copyleft licenses, in particular (while sometimes
  admittedly abused by a few) are not intended nor designed to be 
  &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; licenses.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">One-Slide Introduction to FLOSS Licensing</h2>
  <p>
<p>(roughly) 2 forms of FLOSS licensing: highly permissive
    &amp; copyleft.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong> forms are much more permissive than any
    proprietary license.</p>
<p>FLOSS licenses <em>encourage</em> code reuse&hellip;</p>
<p>copyleft licensors additionally have a <em>policy</em> goal of
    maximizing software freedom.</p>
  </p>

 <h1 class="top-title">Copyleft Is a Tool, Not a Principle</h1>
<p>
<q class="copious">Copyleft is a <span class="fragment highlight-green">strategy</span> of
utilizing copyright law to pursue the policy goal of fostering &amp;
encouraging the equal &amp; inalienable right to copy, share, modify &amp;
improve creative works of authorship. Copyleft &hellip; describes any method
that utilizes the copyright system to achieve the aforementioned
goal. Copyleft as a concept is usually implemented in the details of a
specific copyright license &hellip; Copyright holders of creative work can
unilaterally implement these licenses for their own works to build
communities that collaboratively share &amp; improve those copylefted
creative works.
<p align=right> &mdash; Definition of copyleft from

<section>
 <h2 class="top-title">A Constitution Isn't Principles</h2>
 <p>A Constitution, and the laws that operate under it, are detailed, <span class="fragment
 highlight-green">enforceable</span> implementation of Principles behind a
   society.  </p>

<h2 class="top-title">The GPL As a Constitution</h2>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Constitution and Law</h3>

 <p class="fragment">So, I used to say: &ldquo;copyleft is the Constitution of software development community&rdquo;.</p>

  <p class="fragment">But, GPL (specifically) is a detailed legal
  statute <em>and</em> Constitution rolled into one.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Copyleft suffers from the same problems any legal
    statue (including but not limited to): how is it enforced, and who can
    enforce it?</p>
</section>
    
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">How GPL Is Enforced?</h3>

  <p class="fragment">As a copyright license, copyright holders are those
    with the right to enforce.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Modulo single-copyright-holder &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo;
  licensors (e.g., Oracle with MySQL), generally speaking, copyright holders
    work on their own or with a charity to seek compliance.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 class="top-title">The Principles</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Most follow
  the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/principles.html">Principles
  of Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement</a>, as published by Conservancy, to
  ensure the <strong>policy goals</strong> of copyleft are paramount to
    anything else.</p>
</section>
  
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">How Does this Relate To NAS?</h3>


  <p class="fragment">First, many (not all, obviously) NAS devices run Linux,
    which is licensed primarily under GPLv2-only.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Second, many NAS devices run Samba, which is widely
    used in the NAS community for SMB.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">How Does this Relate To Conservancy?</h3>

  
  <p class="fragment">Conservancy is the primary organization doing GPL
  enforcement for both Linux and Samba, through coalitions of copyright
  holders who have formally asked Conservancy to act on their behalf in
  enforcement actions.</p>
</section>
<section class="copious">
  <h3 class="top-title">Viewing  NAS Market as a n00b</h3>

  <p class="fragment">We at Conservancy get a strange view of the NAS
    market.</p>

  <p class="fragment">While you all stay on top of things about NAS, we're on
    the bottom of things: noticing the products when something goes wrong.</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html">
      Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on
      top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of
      things.
    <p align="right"> &mdash; Donald Knuth, noted Computer Scientist</p></blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">The High-End Success Story</h3>

  <p class="fragment">If you are a high-end NAS vendor, you probably have
  very little to worry about.</p>
  <p class="fragment">You likely employ (or want to employ) upstream developers.</p>
  <p class="fragment">They're going to tell you what you need to do to stay
    in compliance.</p>

</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">The High-End Success Story</h3>
  <p class="fragment">It's not that high end vendors never violate GPL.</p>
  <p class="fragment">It's that it's a small community, where developers talk
    to each other.</p>
  <p class="fragment">High-end vendors are also sophisticated; as
  organizations, they learn fast (have to, to stay competitive), and are
    around for the long haul.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">If I violate?</h3>
  <p class="fragment">If you violate in the high end market, frankly, you'll
    likely just get a friendly call from Jeremy Allison, and he'll help you
    find someone to help you upstream your code.</p>
</section>  
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Why Is It Easy There?</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Both customer and vendor are highly sophisticated.</p>
  <p class="fragment">In particular, customers often have engineers on staff
    who will ask the right question during product evaluation.</p>
</section>
<section class="copious">
  <h3 class="top-title">Across the Train Tracks</h3>
  <p>&hellip; but I live on the bottom of things &mdash; the middle and low-end market</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html">
      Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on
      top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of
      things.
    <p align="right"> &mdash; Donald Knuth, noted Computer Scientist</p></blockquote>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">A Very Different Situation</h3>
  <p>There are of course middle &amp; low-end vendors who do the right thing.</p>
  <p class="fragment">My sad news to them: your competitors
  are <strong>undercutting</strong> you by getting away with massive GPL
    violations on a regular basis.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">What I've Gleaned</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Sitting at the bottom of the supply chain, receiving
    reports from the general public of GPL violations, I sometimes have to
    reverse-engineer what's happening, but here's what I've gleaned:</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">I've Gleaned:</h3>
  <p class="fragment">The low-end vendors who would actually send someone to
  SNIA SDC probably have engineering teams and hold System-on-Chip (SoC)
  vendors accountable on firmwares (or have your own firmwares, just like the
  high-end market).</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Your Competition Is Cheating</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Shenzhen manufacturers (obviously) mass-produce these
  SoC, and because FLOSS is easy to integrate and incorporate &hellip;</p>
  <p class="fragment">&hellip; they're able to cut costs by ignoring
    compliance requirements entirely.</p>
  <p class="fragment">IMO, it's in the interest of folks who actually invest
  in NAS technologies to stop these people who are free-riding on the
    licenses that keep the communities going.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">A Few Bits About Compliance</h3>
      <p class="fragment">Just in case you're not in compliance, I'll spend a
        few minutes about copyleft compliance requirements.</p>
  <p class="fragment">My first piece of advice remains: ask your engineers
    first, not your lawyers!</p>

</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">A Legal Mechanism for Technical Details</h3>
      <p class="fragment">While hearing it's a copyright license might
      indicate the lawyer is your first call&hellip;
      <p class="fragment">&hellip;in fact, most of the most violated terms of copyleft
        are more <em>technology-focused</em>
        than <em>legally-focused</em>.</p>

      <p class="fragment">Indeed, the most important requirement
        is <strong>complete, corresponding source (CCS).</strong></p>
  <p class="fragment">(Don't believe the compliance industrial complex hype!)</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Copyleft at its Core</h3>
  
<p>At its core, copyleft's primary goal is to give downstream users the means
  and capacity to generate and utilize binaries in the same manner that
  upstream did.</p>
</section>
<section class="copious">
  <h3 class="top-title">How GPLv3 Says CCS</h3>
  <q class="copious">
The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means
all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
those activities.
  </q>
<p align="right">
&mdash; GPLv3§1
</p>
</section>
<section class="copious">
  <h3 class="top-title">How GPLv2 Says CCS</h3>

<q class="copious">
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under § 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of § 1 &amp; 2 above provided that you … [a]ccompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code … The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.</q>
<p align="right">
&mdash; GPLv2§3
</p></section>

<section>
<h3 class="top-title">Testing CCS</h3>
<p class="fragment">
  Enforcement must often use a “know it when I see it” standard.
  <span class="fragment">(i.e., can we take your CCS build it, and install it?)</span></p>
<p class="fragment">We’ve reached compliant CCS with hundreds of companies:
  <span class="fragment">but that didn’t mean the CCS was pretty.</span></p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 class="top-title">Best Way to Test CCS?</h3>
<p class="fragment">Find an embedded engineer who <strong>didn't</strong>
  work on the product and ask that engineer to build from sources a new
  firmware and install it on the device.</p></section>
<section>
<h3 class="top-title">Lessons Learned from Examining A Pristine Example</h3>
<p>There's  a full paper available online on building CCS:</p>
<p class="fragment"><a href="http://compliance.guide/pristine-example">compliance.guide/pristine-example</a></p>
<p class="fragment">It’s part of a larger tutorial called <a href="https://copyleft.org/guide/"><em>Copyleft and the GNU General Public License: A Comprehensive Tutorial and Guide</em></a> at copyleft.org.</p>
<p class="fragment">The Guide contains over 150 pages of tutorials materials
  about how copyleft works &amp; how copyleft works.</p>
