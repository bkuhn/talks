# My History

+ Worked my first GPL enforcement case in 1999 (as FSF volunteer).

+ Started working for FSF in 2000 (was there until 2005).

+ Now: President &amp; Distinguished Technologist of Software Freedom Conservancy &amp; on Board of Directors of the FSF.

+ Plurality of my time since 1999 has been spent on GPL enforcement.
     + I'm probably the person most &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for every major USA GPL enforcement action.

# How GPL Works (Theoretically)

+ Copyright: the internationalized standard for authors' controls over works.

+ Use copyright license to grant permission.

+ Make permission conditional on giving your downstream the four freedoms.

+ This is the copyright law hack of copyleft.

+ Copyright rules require compliance with the license.

# How GPL Works (In Reality)

+ What do you do when someone violates?
     + (and social pressure for compliance fails)?

+ Violation of the license means lost rights for distribution.
     + See GPLv2&sect;4 &amp; GPLv3&sect;8
     + Further distribution thereafter (even in compliance) is copyright infringement.

+ Copyright holders must use copyright enforcement:n
     + &hellip; but for a *good* cause: the four freedoms.
     + &ldquo;using the tools of the oppressor against the oppressor&rdquo;

# Complexity of Modern Enforcement

+ Not all GPL enforcers are created equal anymore.

+ Oracle, after all, holds MySQL's copyrights now &amp; enforces.
     + I'd call this the corrupt version of what I do.

+ Compliance must be paramount &hellip;
     + &hellip; over all other interests.
     + This has been called &ldquo;community enforcement&rdquo;.
     + What's that mean?

# Community Enforcement

+ All community enforcement follows this rote procedure:
     + Receive a violation report from an end-user.
     + Verify it's really is a violation.
     + Send a letter to the violator.
     + CCS-Ask: Ask the violator to submit CCS candidates
     + Review and provide feedback on CCS.
     + If CCS has issues, goto CCS-Ask.
     + Ask violator to inform past customers.
     + Ask violator to cover reasonably hourly cost of this work.
     + Restore copyright permissions.

+ Let's talk about the money issue first.
