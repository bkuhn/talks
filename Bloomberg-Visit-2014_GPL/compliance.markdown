% 15 Years of Copyleft License Compliance: A Historical Perspective
% Bradley M. Kuhn
% Tuesday 15 April 2014

# My History

+ Worked my first GPL enforcement case in 1999 (as FSF volunteer).

+ Started working for FSF in 2000 (was there until 2005).

+ Now: President &amp; Distinguished Technologist of Software Freedom Conservancy &amp; on Board of Directors of the FSF.

+ Plurality of my time since 1999 has been spent on GPL enforcement.
     + I'm probably the person &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for every major USA GPL enforcement action.

# Nature of Free Software Community

<img width="340" height="512" align=right src="detective-munch.jpg"/>

+ Through the eyes of a GPL enforcer &hellip;

+ The Free Software Community is separated into two equally important groups:
     + The permissively licensed, who use social pressure to liberate code.
     + The copyleft licensed, whose license requires liberation.

+ Copyright infringement shouldn't be a crime &hellip;
     + &hellip; but if you analogize, I'm the only cop left on the beat.

# On Requirement By License

<img src="Constitution.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Social pressure *does* work &hellip;
     + &hellip; and should be used (and is), even for copylefted software.
     + &hellip; enforcement is a last resort.

+ GPL == Constitution of Software Freedom Land.
     + a &ldquo;written down&rdquo; embodiment of core principles.

+ GPL's a detailed implementation of the four freedoms:
     + freedom to run and study.
     + freedom to improve.
     + freedom to share.
     + freedom to share improvements.

# How GPL Works (Theoretically)

+ Copyright: the internationalized standard for authors' controls over works.

+ Use copyright license to grant permission.

+ Make permission conditional on giving your downstream the four freedoms.

+ This is the copyright law hack of copyleft.

+ Copyright rules require compliance with the license.

# How GPL Works (In Reality)

<img src="copyleft-irl.jpg" align="right"  />

+ What do you do when someone violates?
     + (and social pressure for compliance fails)?

+ Copyright enforcement
     + &hellip; but for a *good* cause: the four freedoms.
     + &ldquo;using the tools of the oppressor against the oppressor&rdquo;

# Earliest Copyleft Programs

<img src="emacs.png" align="right" />

+ GNU Emacs: was the first GPL'd program.

+ AFAIK Emacs' copyleft never been violated.

# Second Copyleft Program

<img src="gcc_sm.png" align="right" width="440" height="508"  />

+ GCC: second GPL'd program.
     + much more interesting to proprietary software companies.

+ So, who was the first GPL violator?

# The NeXT Shall be First

<img src="steve-jobs-next.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Objective-C front end.

<p>In "The NeXT Book" by Bruce Webster, he says: (page 134):</p>
<p>
	Objective C is based on the Gnu C compiler developed by
	Richard Stallman.  Release 0.9 has merged the Objective
	C syntax with the the Gnu C compiler to speed up compilation
	and to produce faster, more efficient code.
</p>


<p>Are they using FSF software in their product? Or is Webster just badly
explaining the situation ...  and Objective C is just preprocessing and
passing C to gcc.</p>

<p>Otherwise Gang, I see a Copyleft violation right?</p>

<p>In response to Steve Simmons' inquiry about an Objective-C
front-end for GCC, NeXT will be making our modifications to
GCC for Objective-C available very soon.</p>

<p>Once GCC-1.36 is released (any day now), I will create a patch
kit which will be announced on this mailing list.  (The modifications
are very small.)</p>

# Tar Wars

<img width="274" height="383" align=right src="tar-wars.gif"/>

<p> A long time ago, in a city far far away, the Empires had taken GNU tar
and placed it into proprietary backup solutions.  A small band of freedom
fighters enforced the GPL to liberate users who were oppressed by the
proprietary nature of GPL violators.</p>

# Tar Wars

+ Tape backup systems essential in late 1990s.

+ Many companies made forks of GNU Tar, and violated.

+ Sysadmins were good at finding these violations.

+ All but one violator came into compliance.

# Court May Not Mandate Source Release

+ Last GNU tar enforcement I ever did was circa mid-2002.

+ Company decided to *remove* tar &amp; rewrite rather than compliance.

+ Let's sue!

+ Lawyers told me courts are unlikely to order a source release as a remedy.

+ Courts usually give money and an injunction
     - Company already gave latter of their own accord (de-facto injunction)

# Coalition of the Willing

<img align=right src="wrt54g.png"/>

+ Spring 2003: dozens of reports on WRT54G.

+ Discussions begin with Cisco (who'd bought Linksys just weeks before)

+ Story hits slashdot on 2003-06-08

+ FSF puts together group to do enforcement.
     - key members: Erik Andersen (BusyBox) &amp; Harald Welte (Linux)

# Compliance Takes Soooo Long

+ FSF represents the coalition.

+ Broadcom is discovered as upstream.

+ WRT54G source is released (but wireless driver kept proprietary).

+ Broadcom argues FCC prohibits; FSF agrees not to pursue (can't really anyway).

+ WRT54G releases spawns OpenWRT community.

+ Harald is frustrated.

# GPL-violations.org

<img align=right src="harald-welte.jpg"/>

+ FSF was initially shy about lawsuits.

+ Harald disagreed with FSF strategy (in hindsight, he was right).

+ launches multiple lawsuits in Germany (about 8 between 2005-2008).

+ Quite successful, although has in some cases, courts only grant injunction.

# GCC Redux, 2003-2005

+ Embedded systems become major part of industry.

+ GCC is the best compiler.

+ Many companies start making GCC-based toolchains.

+ Focus of post-WRT54G enforcement at FSF.

# Funding Crisis for Enforcement

+ FSF had hoped to raise funds &ldquo;certifying compliance&rdquo;.

+ You can't break even on this for less than $10,000/release.

+ No one is willing to pay (still true today, AFAICT).

+ Those who'd know enough to buy services think they'll get away with violations anyway.

# Money

+ No one in non-profits is getting rich from this.

+ Who should pay for enforcement: 
     - Those who *comply* or those who *violate*?
     - Individual donors?

+ There must be a deterrent.

+ Non-profit enforcement == accountability.

+ Confidentiality is something violators ask for.

# Enforcement Corruption: MySQL

<img width="274" height="383" align=right src="marten-mickos.jpg"/>

+ Proprietary relicensing (by holding all copyright).
     - As I spoke about this morning.

# Embedded Violations Prevalent

+ Erik Andersen becomes exasperated by mid-2006.
     - post-Linksys compliance, router &amp; NAS market is a violation haven.

+ Erik asks for help.

+ Conservancy becomes his enforcement agent (&amp; receive some others' &copy; assignment)

+ Conservancy has had > 100 GPL violations queued for action since 2007.
     - Conservancy's list is now > 300

# The Era of GPL Litigation

+ Lawsuits become undeniably necessary.
     - Dan Ravicher file some in USA: for Conservancy &amp; Erik.

+ Focus is to settle:
     - More than anything else, we want full compliance &hellip;
     - &hellip; on *all* GPL'd and LGPL'd components &hellip;
     - &hellip; judge is unlikely to grant us all that &hellip;
     - &hellip; so we work hard to settle on that request &hellip;
     - &hellip; taking extra money &amp; injunctions only as a consolation prize.

# Linksys Redux

+ 2003-2004: all embedded consumer devices are VxWorks.

+ Circa late 2004, BusyBox/Linux &amp; GNU/Linux slowly becomes the Linksys default again.

+ FSF finally gets fed up and sues.

+ One wonders: Why don't these companies just come into compliance before getting sued?

# Challenges of Modern Compliance

+ Saavy violators meant intelligent discussion.
    + Jobs knew just what he was trying to get away by proprietarizing Objective C.

+ Clueless violators means difficult conversations:
     + Me: &ldquo;Your software violates GPL.&rdquo;
     + Them: &ldquo;We make hardware.&rdquo;
     + Me: &ldquo;I know, but it has software in it.  Our members' software. Under the GPL.&rdquo;
     + Them: &ldquo;No, it doesn't. We make hardware.&rdquo;
     + Me: &ldquo;But your firmware download&hellip;on *your* website&hellip;that's software.&rdquo;
     + Them: &ldquo;Oh, that's not ours.  We got that from someone.  Nothing to do with us.&rdquo;

+ Having the above conversation across four phone calls every two months is why I seem so insane most of the time.

# The Upstream Problem

<img align=left src="michael-scott.jpg"/>

When I said that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I
don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't
arrest a guy who was just passing drugs from one guy to another.

<p align="right">
 -- Michael Scott, *The Office* (USA Version)
</p>

# Suppliers Bully OEMs, AFAICT 

+ I'd be the worst police officer in the world.

+ No one ever turns &ldquo;states' evidence&rdquo;
     - &hellip; at least they don't for _me_, anyway.

+ Me: &ldquo;Please, just tell me on the record your supplier violated when distributing to you.&rdquo;

+ Them: &ldquo;We'll work with our upstream to get into compliance.&rdquo;

# Embedded Device Software Freedom

+ Sure, I've got the sources.

+ But, can I build it in the same way the company did?

+ If I get it built, can I install it?

+ By the time I get all that working, will the device be discontinued?

+ Will they get away with it if they do, only to violate in the next product line?

+ In the age of the embedded device, copyleft seeks to answer these questions correctly.

# GPL Predicted this Problem 

+ Even in 1991, RMS made sure GPLv2 handled this.

# GPLv2: More than Just Source

<p>For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus <strong>the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable</strong>.</p>

<p>(emphasis mine)</p>

# GPLv2: More than Just Source

+ &ldquo;the scripts to control&hellip;&rdquo; gets us close.

+ It handles most of the issues.

+ I even argued it includes authorized install information.
     + Unfortunately, RMS gave in on that one.

# GPLv3: Installation Information

<span class="fitonslide">
<p><strong>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo;</strong> for a User Product <strong>means any methods,
procedures</strong>, authorization keys, <strong>or</strong> other <strong>information required to install
and execute modified versions</strong> of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The <strong>information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code</strong> is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</p>

<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.</p>
</span>

<p>(emphasis mine)</p>

# GPLv3: Installation Information

+ In my view, just clarifies GPLv2's terse wording.

+ In any event, it makes it certain.

+ Users of device can modify and upgrade their devices &hellip;
     + &hellip; as it should be.

+ This is one of the reasons projects should upgrade to GPLv3.

# Today.

<img align="right" height="473" width="557" src="DQWindmill.gif"/>

+ I continue enforcement for Conservancy.
     - new reports each week.

+ I wish more individuals and non-profits would enforce.

+ There are saavy violators out there that we're dealing with now.
      - I wish I could say more on the record.

# Constant Vigilance!

<img align="right" src="moody.jpg"/>

+ GPL Violations *are* *everywhere*.

+ My only recourse is &hellip;
     - Constant Vigilance!

+ I'm not giving up on this &hellip;
       + &hellip; until there is no developer left in the world &hellip;
       + &hellip; who cares to enforce the GPL for the rights of users &hellip;
       + &hellip; no matter how many embedded companies try to make me stop &hellip;
       + &hellip; or how many anti-GPL developers they recruit to try to stop me.
