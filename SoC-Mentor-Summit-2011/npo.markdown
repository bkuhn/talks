# Who Am I?

+ Two official roles:
    - On Board of Directors of Free Software Foundation.
    - President and Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ Much of my views are influenced by these roles.


# Why *Did* People Write Free Software?

<img src="gnu-head.jpg" align="right" />

+ Consider GNU project.

+ Founded on idealism.

+ Recruited volunteers.

+ Those projects remain community-oriented.

# The Danger of Our Success

+ Open Source is a corporate *fad* now.

+ VC's use Open Source manipulatively.
     - proprietary relicensing
     - proprietary add-ons

+ Companies employ developers &hellip;
     - &hellip; maybe to work on Free Software.
     - &hellip; but companies control employee's time in their interest.

# Where Things May Be Headed

+ FLOSS sometimes drifts toward for-profit corporate interest.

+ Or, it's purely thrown over the wall.
    - At corporate whim

+ Project decisions are made by companies.

# Software Freedom Governance?

+ Yet, corporate sponsorships are common and desired.

+ But for-profit control of projects can be dangerous.

+ Fedora vs. Ubuntu as Coke vs. Pepsi

# Danger of For-Profits

+ For-profits act in interest in shareholders.

+ Those who care most about software are usually *not* shareholders.

+ Interests do align sometimes with software freedom community.

+ Common ground is needed so multiple for-profits can participate.

# Non-Profits are Different

+ 501(c)(3) Non-profits act in interest of the public good.

+ Software freedom is best when in public good.

+ Non-profit orgs (NPOs) are best place for software freedom.

+ Provide a place to receive philanthropy
     - (e.g., a place for SoC mentor funds to go)

# What Can NPOs Do?

+ Collect (USA-tax-deductible) donations for a project.
      - both individual and corporate.

+ Distribute that money to advance &amp; improve project (and public good).

+ Make sure project isn't controlled by for-profit interests.

+ Help leadership with non-technical decisions.

+ Neutral ground when corporations sponsor.

# Organization Proliferation

+ You can go your own way, but &hellip;

+ Too many NPOs will confuse donors.

+ Each needs a board of directors, incorporation, meetings, IRS filings.

+ Hackers end up doing work they hate.

+ Less Free Software gets written.

# Aggregating Under Umbrella

+ Sometimes called a &ldquo;fiscal sponsor&rdquo;
    + it doesn't mean they give you money &hellip;
    + &hellip; but rather handle assets for you.

+ Many projects get same benefit of single non-profit.

+ Current 501(c)(3) options are:
     - Software Freedom Conservancy
     - Software in the Public Interest
     - Apache Software Foundation

# Software Freedom Conservancy

    - basic legal services (incl license enforcement)

# Software in the Public Interest

# Apache Software Foundation

    - Incubator process.
