# Nature of Free Software Community

<img width="340" height="512" align=right src="detective-munch.jpg"/>

+ Through the eyes of a GPL enforcer &hellip;

+ The Free Software Community is separated into two equally important groups:
     + The permissively licensed, who use social pressure to liberate code.
     + The copyleft licensed, whose license requires liberation.

+ (Copyright infringement shouldn't be a crime, BTW: this is just an analogy.)

# Should Copyleft Exist?

+ I'm not objecting to the debate: Should we have copyleft?

+ But I'm somewhat sick of defending the idea of copyleft.

+ Conservancy has both types of projects:
     + We help our permissively-licensed be permissive.
     + We help our copyleft projects be copyleft.

+ Both are useful, and Conservancy does both.
     + But we'd do a disservice to our copylefted member projects if we ignored violations.

# Upholding Copyleft

+ When those projects started:
     + individual copyright holders wanted legal protection through copyleft.

+ It's part of their culture and ethos.

+ Conservancy's job:
     + Do non-software-development/documentation tasks for projects.
     + Enforcement clearly qualifies.

# How Copyleft Works

+ What do you do when someone violates?
     + (and social pressure for compliance fails)?

+ Copyright enforcement
     + &hellip; (yes, similar stuff to what the MPAA does: EEP!)
     + &hellip; but for a *good* cause: the four freedoms.
     + &ldquo;using the tools of the oppressor against the oppressor&rdquo;

# &ldquo;Traditional&rdquo; Compliance

+ FSF asked for copyright assignment to enforce for some GNU packages.

+ FSF's roles were admittedly tough to consider separately:
      + Employer of the authors of many GNU packages.
      + copyright holder of package copyrights.
      + author of GPL &amp; related licenses.
      + advocacy organization for software freedom.

+ Confusion is really just victim of being first.

+ (Full Disclosure: I'm on FSF's Board of Directors &hellip; but also &hellip;)

# Compliance: Service to Developers

+ &hellip; but also &hellip; my day job is Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ Conservancy gives a <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/members/services/">wide range of services</a> to projects.

+ Compliance is just &ldquo;one of those services&rdquo;.

# Historical BusyBox Enforcement

<img src="peanut-butter-jelly-time-comic.png" align="right"  />

+ Erik Andersen rewrote BusyBox from (mostly) scratch in early 2000's.

+ BusyBox became standard Unix-like userspace for embedded systems.

+ Linux plus BusyBox was the Peanut and Jelly sandwich of embedded systems.
     + Usually out of compliance.

# Is It Really Degrading?

+ The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/478308/">Tempest in a Toybox</a>.

+ BusyBox enforcement was de-facto Linux enforcement.
     + BusyBox copyright holders (Conservancy and Andersen) asked for comprehensive GPL compliance.
     + Some Linux developers felt this was unfair.

***

> Busybox is arguably the most litigated piece of GPL software in the world.  &hellip; Litigants have sometimes requested remedies outside the scope of busybox itself&hellip;

# Denys, The Voice of Reason

<img src="denys-vlasenko-scaled.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Current BusyBox maintainer has that special skill of Free Software developers &hellip;
      + &hellip; to find the sane arguments hidden among troll-ish attacks.

+ I walk through Brussels on the phone with Denys &hellip;
      + &hellip; the day before FOSDEM 2012 &hellip;
      + &hellip; and he convinces me:

+ To continue with enforcement, Linux developers must be involved.

# Why Special Case Linux?

+ Linux violations are rampant.

+ Denys asked us to engage.

+ Also, various Linux developers &hellip;
     - &hellip; like Matthew Garrett &hellip;
     - &hellip; had bugged Conservancy for years to help with enforcement.

+ GPL Compliance Project for Linux Developers gives structure to Linux compliance activity.

# Compliance As Collaboration

+ Multiple Conservancy projects are GPL or LGPL.

+ Nearly all agree on compliance goals:
       + Simply this: work with violators to get a source release that **works**.

+ Conservancy does the work:
     - giving updates to copyright holders involved &hellip;
     - &hellip; using the tried-and-true, simple Free Software community tool:
     - just a mailing list (&amp; occasionally face-to-face meeting).

# Who Can Join?

+ Any copyright holder on an existing Conservancy project can request enforcement:
       + approval for a compliance program required by projects' leadership committee.

+ Linux developers can join &hellip;
      + &hellip; even though Linux proper isn't a Conservancy project.
      + They join through a &ldquo;special&rdquo; project &hellip;
      + GPL Compliance Project for Linux Developers.


# Please Never Forget

+ GPL compliance is (roughly) only about 5-10% of what Conservancy does.

+ Tim Bird may think GPL compliance work is controversial:
       + Conservancy disagrees.

+ Everything Conservancy does is the uncontroversial but important non-software-development tasks for Free Software projects.
