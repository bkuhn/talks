  <h3 class="top-title">DISCLAIMER</h3>

  <p>This talk is only tangentially related to my day job (i.e., the talk is
  about software freedom!).  While I don't think I'll say anything in this
  talk my employer would strongly object to, my employer probably has no
  opinion on the online poker industry, other than Conservancy's general
  opposition to any proprietary software.  Nevertheless, the opinions in this
    talk are entirely my own.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">I Don't Know Games</h3>

  <p>I'm better known for my work on software freedom policy and licensing&hellip;</p>
  <p class="fragment">&hellip;<strong>But</strong>, I did a side-gig working
  on a FOSS game for about 3 years.</p>
  <p class="fragment">This is the story of its failure&hellip; </p>
  <p class="fragment"> (&hellip; and its transient success). </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Poker Is Different</h3>

  <p>How would you define the game of poker? </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">&ldquo;Correct&rdquo; Definition of Poker</h3>

  <p>Poker is a gambling game of strategy played by people
  for <span class="fragment highlight-green">money</span>, using cards
  (priority of these things are in <strong>that</strong> order).</p>
</section>

  <section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Brief Popularity History of Poker</h3>

  <p>Poker is very popular in USA, UK, and Australia.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Played regularly in &ldquo;home games&rdquo; with
    friends, but larger games legal in casinos in all those countries and
    throughout the world.</p>
  <p class="fragment">5 Card Draw games at saloons are part of USAmerican
  mythology (some of which is based in fact).</p>
  <p class="fragment">Mainstream popular rise, particularly for No-limit
  Texas Hold'em (NL HE) variant began in 1999 with UK's <cite>Late Night
  Poker</cite> television series.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Rise of Online Poker</h3>
  <img align="right" src="img/paradise-poker.jpg"/>
  <p class="fragment">In 1998/1999, first online poker sites, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Poker">Planet Poker</a>
    and Paradise Poker, launch.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Comparatively speaking, poker is straightforward to
    implement (2-D, minimal graphics needed).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Rise of Online Poker</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Watershed moment: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Moneymaker">Chris Moneymaker</a> (yes, it's his real
  name from birth.  Journalists verified it.)</p>

  <p class="fragment">Moneymaker wins an US$86 entry fee online poker
  &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; to gain entry to the World Series of Poker
  (WSoP).</p>
  <p class="fragment">Moneymaker ultimately wins the 2003 WSoP Main Event for
    a prize of US$2.5 million.</p></section>

  <section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Rise of Online Poker</h3>
      <p class="fragment">During the Moneymaker era (2003&mdash;2011), there are three major
      online poker &ldquo;networks&rdquo;: 
      &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Tilt_Poker">Full
      Tilt Poker</a>, Pokerstars, and Cereus Poker Network (UltimateBet and
        Absolute Poker)</p>
      <p class="fragment">Plus dozens and dozens of secondary and tertiary
        networks with &ldquo;skins&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="fragment">Online poker market was estimated in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-study-us-online-poker-market-worth-up-to-33-billion-236026101.html">the multi-billions
    by this time</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3 class="top-title">FOSS Was Both Early &amp; Late</h3>
  <p class="fragment">The history of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is
    riddled with playing &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; to existing proprietary.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Ironically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC_poker">IRC
  Poker</a> had been the first &ldquo;online&rdquo; poker system (for play
    money only).</p>
  <p class="fragment">In the early 2000s, no one in FOSS was maintaining its
    infrastructure.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 class="top-title">The One True Hand Evaluator</h3>
      <p class="fragment">The first comprehensive poker hand evaluator that
        ever existed, amazingly, was under the GPL.</p>
      <p class="fragment">Started in 1994 by Cliff Matthews (ctn), it
        supported every single game.</p>
      <p class="fragment">I don't know for sure, but I suspect every online
        poker system uses (a fork of) it.</p>
      <p class="fragment">If only network services copyleft (i.e., Affero
        GPL) had existed in 1994. :)</p>
  </section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">FOSS Tries to Leapfrog</h3>

  <p>A French company called Mekensleep attempts to make the ultimate 3-D
    online poker site (spoiler alert: <span class="fragment">it failed</span>).</p>
  <p class="fragment">But they hire my lifelong friend, Lo&iuml;c Dachary as
    their CTO.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Lo&iuml;c morally will never write proprietary
    software, so the entire system is under the Affero GPL and/or GPL.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">No One Wants Poker to Look Like a Video Game</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Poker, in essence, is gambling.</p>
  <p class="fragment">The goal is to maximize hands per hour (MORE GAMBLING).</p>
  <p class="fragment">No one plays just one table (usually at least 2-3).</p>
  <p class="fragment">The player-preferred UI, thus, has barely changed since 1998.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">FOSS's Opportunity Lost</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Online cheating and government raids became a plague for poker.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Cereus (UB &amp; Absolute) founders actually wrote a
  &ldquo;god mode&rdquo; to cheat customers.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Full Tilt mismanaged funds (comingled player balances
    with operating expenses) and played a shell game.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Transparency of FOSS could have helped here.</p></section> 
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">The Harder Software</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Focus on making only the game work meant that
    infrastructural software for site management wasn't written:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Cashier services</li>
    <li class="fragment">Player database management and marketing</li>
    <li class="fragment">Collusion detection</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="fragment">Even though Pokersource was a &ldquo;complete
  system&rdquo; &mdash; fast, efficient and scalable server, two clients,
  including the first Javascript client in online poker history &mdash; you
    couldn't launch a online poker business with it.  Then &hellip;</p></section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Repurpose to Play Money</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Lo&ium;c built a consulting business, called OutFlop,
    around the existing code.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Primary client was a French social media site who
    deployed play money version for prizes.</p>
  <p class="fragment">We were a network of contractors, and Lo&ium;c shielded
  each contractor from deployment &mdash; doling out small tasks (2&mdash;10
    days work) and paying by project.</p></section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Was this Success?</h3>
  <p class="fragment">For approximately three years, about 10 contractors had paying,
    part-time jobs improving a 100% FOSS game codebase.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Should we really define FOSS success as a project that
    lasts a generation (like Linux)?</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Why FOSS Online Poker Is Likely Hopeless</h3>
  <p class="fragment">October 13, 2006: USA's Unlawful Internet Gaming
    Act</p>
  <p class="fragment">USA DoJ warns all poker sites to cease USA operation
    immediately; PartyPoker is the only one that does.</p>
  <p class="fragment">April 15, 2011: All poker sites still operating in the
    USA are shut down.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Full Tilt's pyramid scheme is revealed within
    weeks.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Why FOSS Online Poker Is Likely Hopeless</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Pokerstars quickly makes a deal with USA DoJ to pay a
    fine <strong>and</strong> acquire FullTilt's player debt.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Pokerstars now holds a strong majority in the market;
  other players are long-standing stalwarts.</p>
  <p class="fragment">More importantly, the investment in operational
    software would be prohibitive for a FOSS competitor.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Is There a Future in Play Money?</h3>
  <p class="fragment">The FOSS code is <em>there</em> (even with full test coverage on
    poker-network, thanks to me :) to deploy play-money poker.</p>
    <p class="fragment">Why isn't anyone using it?</p>
   <p class="fragment">Zynga, as it turns out, dominated the play-money market because
    they were early on Facebook.</p>
     <p class="fragment">Would there be value in play-money Mastadon Poker as
    a social media add-on?</p>
</section>
  
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Is There a Future in Play Money?</h3>
   <p class="fragment">Fact is, people who love poker enough to deploy a FOSS
     play-money site think play money poker is not even a game worth
     playing.</p></section>
