# Open Source / Free Software Governance?

+ Corporate sponsorship becoming more common.

+ For-profit control of projects can be dangerous.

+ MySQL (& other Sun projects) is one example of how it can go wrong.

# Non-Profit vs. For-Profit

+ For-profits act in interest in shareholders.

+ 501(c)(3) Non-profits act in interest of the public good.

+ Software freedom is best when in public good.

+ Non-profit orgs (NPOs) are best place for software freedom.

# What Can NPOs Do?

+ Collect (USA-tax-deductible) donations for a project.
      - both individual and corporate.

+ Distribute that money to advance project (and public good).

+ Make sure project isn't controlled by for-profit interests.

+ Help leadership with non-technical decisions.

# Organization Proliferation

+ Too many NPOs will confuse donors.

+ Need a board of directors, incorporation, meetings, IRS filings.

+ Hackers end up doing work they hate.

+ Less Free Software gets written.

# Aggregating Under Umbrella

+ Conservancy is designed as one organization.

+ Composed of many different projects.

+ Each has its own funds.

+ One board of directors, one non-technical governance structure.

# Funding Through Conservancy 

+ Travel to conferences.

+ Handling Google SoC.

+ Conference invoicing and contracts.

+ Stipends and paid development contracts for developers.

+ Fiscal oversight.

# How to Join?

+ Looking for established projects.

+ Relatively Informal process.
