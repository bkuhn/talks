# What Is Conservancy?

+ Software Freedom Conservancy is a charity based in the USA.
     + That means we're legally required to operate in the public good.
     + Contrast: a trade association, like Linux Foundation, whose charge is to operate in
       a manner that advances common business interests of an industry.
     + Even further contrast: Red Hat or GitHub, which are for-profit
       companies, that must act in interest of their shareholders.
     
# What Does Conservancy Do?

+ Conservancy provides essential non-software-development work that Open
  Source and Free Software projects need.

+ This includes helping projects ensure their software licenses continue to
  benefit the public.
     + which, in concrete terms, means acting to verify projects' FLOSS
       licenses meet goals their policy.

# Definition of Regulatory Compliance 

<hr/>

> In general, compliance means conforming to a rule, such as a specification,
> policy, standard or law.  Regulatory compliance describes the goal that
> organizations aspire to achieve in their efforts to ensure that they are
> aware of and take steps to comply with relevant laws and regulations.

Compliance [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance)</p> </span>

# Definition of Regulatory Enforcement

<hr/>

> [Regulatory] Enforcement is a necessary product of the process of
> authorization and supervision, in the sense that a regulator must enforce
> compliance with rules. Enforcement is as much about investigating,
> gathering and sharing information as it is about imposing penalties.

Compliance
[from the International Compliance Association](http://www.int-comp.org/faqs-compliance-regulatory-environment),
a financial services professional association</p> </span>

# Regulatory Regimes

+ Typically created with the force of law.

+ In the USA, they are thus typically:
      + legislated by a congressional body &hellip;
      + &hellip; which funds an administrative body to enforce &hellip;
      + &hellip; but nevertheless require the non-profit sector assistance.

# Volkswagen Scandal

+ Volkswagen emissions scandal initially discovered by academic researchers.

+ EPA (the relevant governmental regulatory enforcement body)  enforces based
  on the academic findings.

+ EPA (and other bodies, such as California's regulators) work directly with
  manufacturer to restore compliance.

+ Interesting FAQ on EPA's site at [http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/cert/violations.htm](http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/cert/violations.htm).

# From EPA's FAQ

<hr/>

> Manufacturers are given a reasonable amount of time to develop a plan to complete the repairs, including both the repair procedure and manufacture of any needed parts. Depending on the complexity of the repair and the lead time needed to obtain the necessary components, it could take up to one year to identify corrective actions, develop a recall plan, and issue recall notices.

# Should This Exist?

+ Societal debate on the legitimacy &amp; efficacy of regulatory regimes is appropriate.

+ Libertarians tend to believe they're rarely need.

+ Most others &mdash; everywhere in the political sphere of thought &mdash;
  believe regulatory regimes (&amp; thus regulatory enforcement) are
  valuable.

+ Encouraging avoidance of copyleft is akin to calling to an end to
  regulatory regime that ensures software freedom.

# Voluntary Compliance &amp; Non-Copyleft

+ Non-copyleft licenses grant basic permissions to copy, modify, and
  redistribute software.

+ These rights are not *guaranteed* by those licenses
     + The licenses (&amp; the communities that use them) merely encourage,
       but don't mandate, sharing of software.

+ Non-copyleft is the Open Source and Free Software licensing version of libertarianism:
     + for-profit companies exploit the resource &amp; are entrusted for
       voluntary giving back to the commons.
     + I find it almost anarcho-capitalist in practice.

# Software Sharing Regulatory Regime

+ Copyleft is admittedly a regulatory regime, designed to meet specific
  policy goals.

+ If you're opposed to any regulatory regimes &hellip;
     + (e.g., if you think no one but consumers' purchasing decisions should
        have the power to stop VW's emissions trick) &hellip;
     + then you should certainly oppose copyleft.

+ In my experience, most people prefer some regulatory regime to exist to
  ensure the public good in areas their interest and concern.
     
# The Copyleft

+ Linux and much Open Source and Free Software  use **copyleft** licenses.
    + The GNU General Public License (GPL) is the most common one.

+ Copyleft seeks to give downstream users:
    + the Complete, Corresponding Source code to the binaries.
    + the means and capacity to   generate and utilize binaries in the same
      manner that upstream did  (even if the sources have been further modified).

# Formal Definition of Copyleft

<hr/>

> Copyleft is a strategy of utilizing copyright law to pursue the policy goal
> of fostering &amp; encouraging the equal &amp; inalienable right to copy,
> share, modify &amp; improve creative works of authorship. Copyleft &hellip;
> describes any method that utilizes the copyright system to achieve the
> aforementioned goal. Copyleft as a concept is usually implemented in the
> details of a specific copyright license &hellip; Copyright holders of
> creative work can unilaterally implement these licenses for their own works
> to build communities that collaboratively share &amp; improve [them].

<span class="fitonslide"> <p align=right> &mdash; Definition of copyleft from

# What is GPL Enforcement?

+ Broadly, GPL enforcement is the process of ensuring that redistributors
  grant the rights that copyleft assures.

+ The primary goals are:
     + ensure that the users of a product containing copylefted works can
       participate upstream by testing, building, and enhancing the work on
       the actual device.
     + help distributor themselves join and contribute back to the upstream
       project.

+ *The Principles of Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement* at [sfconservancy.org/linux-compliance/principles.html](https://sfconservancy.org/linux-compliance/principles.html).

# What's a GPL Violation?

+ GPL (both v2 and v3) require:
     + The whole work licensed under GPL.
     + (which means all copyrighted material added must be under
       GPL-compatible licenses.)
     + Complete, Corresponding Source (CCS) of that work provided, under GPL.

+ The licenses terminate upon violation &hellip;
     + &hellip; thus failure to comply means lost distribution rights.
     + &hellip; enforcement uses this rights termination as leverage to
       restore compliance.

# Who Are the Regulators?

+ Copyleft has a community-organized regulatory regime.

+ The authors of the software (i.e., copyright holders) are automatically
  entrusted with enforcement authority.

+ The force of law thus automatically deputizes the authors themselves to
  ensure compliance.

+ The beauty of the legal hack of copyleft goes beyond merely an innovative use of
  copyright law.

# Copyleft's Business Value Proposition

+ Most businesses, particularly small ones, don't want anarcho-capitalism.

+ Equitable regulations create equal playing field for innovators.

+ Fairly enforced copyleft licensing ensures equitable regulation of software
  freedom principles.

+ Copyleft availability limits first mover's advantage; allows immediate
  leveraging of new innovations.

+ Example: Linux adoption in Android mobile devices.

# Copyleft's Business Value Proposition

+ Security through obscurity is known not to work.
    + Non-source code available software is therefore a security risk.

+ Enforced Copyleft **assures** that businesses have the source code of the
software on which they rely.

+ Companies need not fear &ldquo;bad actor&rdquo; vendor (or acquisition of
  their vendor by a bad actor).

# Copyleft's Business Value Proposition

+ Non-copyleft licensing yields a prisoners' dilemma:
      + if the other guy releases code &amp; I don't, I benefit greatly.
      + if both of us do, we *both* get an equitable and pretty good benefit.

+ Copyleft licensing &amp; its enforcement creates a regulatory process that
  assures the optimal outcome for everyone.


# HP Knows This

He says this *despite* HP's heavy investment in Apache-licensed projects like OpenStack.

# If It's Just a Symbol &hellip;

+ If GPL is just merely a symbol with no real authority.
     + why bother?
     + We might as well all be using the Apache license.  

+ An unenforced copyleft is the functional equivalent to a non-copyleft license.

+ Enforcement is the only process to assure the benefits of copyleft.
     + individuals actors can ignore its requirements if no one watches &amp; regulates.

# Enforcement Must Not Be Corrupt

+ Thus, enforcement is necessary for the regulatory regime of copyleft to
  function.

+ We must however learn from the mistakes of other regulatory regimes.

#  Anyone Know Who This Is?

# Banking Regulation Failures

<img height="636" width="500" alight="center" src="carmen-segarra.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Carmen Segarra was a bank examiner for the Federal Reserve in New York who,
  in 2012, started secretly recording the cosy relationship between federal
  regulators and big banks.

+ [*This American Life*, Episode 536](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/536/the-secret-recordings-of-carmen-segarra)
covered her work in detail.

# Avoiding Regulatory Regime Failure

<img height="636" width="500" alight="center" src="carmen-segarra.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Key lesson learned:
       + the free flow of staff &amp; relationship-building between the
         regulators &amp; those they regulate leads to initially subtle
         corruption in selective enforcement which often transforms into
         blatant favoritism &amp; regulatory misconduct.

# The Compliance Industrial Complex

+ As the primary person enforcing the GPL since 1999 &hellip;

+ I've been a major inspiration an industry of lawyers &amp; services &hellip;

+ whose primary goals are: &hellip;
      + scare companies about copyleft software adoption.
      + charge huge fees in an attempt to &ldquo;get their client off&rdquo;
        when they fail to meet copyleft terms.
      + Outspend the regulators by burying us in specious legal arguments
        &amp; political dirty tricks.
 
# The Compliance Industrial Complex

<img height="536" width="428" alight="right" src="VW-law-firm-cartoon.jpg" align="right"  />

+ The compliance industrial complex has made copyleft
  enforcement amazingly expensive.
      + Because we aren't a governmental agency, we have no easy source of funding.

+ Instead, Conservancy is a 501(c)(3) charity, financially supported by the public, to
  do the public good.

# Who Watches the Watchers?

+ The ancient philosophers asked: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?
      + we should still ask this today.

+ Conservancy is a charity regulated itself by the Internal Revenue Service.
      + we must act in the public good, lest we lose our 501(c)(3) status.

+ Others **do** use enforcement corruptly.
      + I encourage you to ask who is doing the enforcing (and why) when you see it
        in action.
