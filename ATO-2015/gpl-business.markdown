# What Does Conservancy Do?

+ Software Freedom Conservancy is a charity based in the USA.
     + That means we're legally required to operate in the public good.
     + Contrast: a trade association, like Linux Foundation, whose charge is to operate in
       a manner that advances common business interests of an industry.
     + Even further contrast: Red Hat or GitHub, which are for-profit
       companies, that must act in interest of their shareholders.
     
+ Conservancy provides essential non-software-development work that Open
  Source and Free Software projects need.

+ This includes helping projects ensure their software licenses continue to
  benefit the public.
     + which, in concrete terms, means acting to verify projects' FLOSS
       licenses meet goals their policy.

# Definition of Regulatory Compliance 

<hr/>

> In general, compliance means conforming to a rule, such as a specification,
> policy, standard or law.  Regulatory compliance describes the goal that
> organizations aspire to achieve in their efforts to ensure that they are
> aware of and take steps to comply with relevant laws and regulations.

Compliance [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance)</p> </span>

# Definition of Regulatory Enforcement

<hr/>

> [Regulatory] Enforcement is a necessary product of the process of
> authorization and supervision, in the sense that a regulator must enforce
> compliance with rules. Enforcement is as much about investigating,
> gathering and sharing information as it is about imposing penalties.

# Regulatory Regimes

+ Typically created with the force of law.

+ In the USA, they are thus typically:
      + legislated by a congressional body &hellip;
      + &hellip; which funds an administrative body to enforce &hellip;
      + &hellip; but nevertheless require the non-profit sector assistance.

# Volkswagen Scandal

+ Volkswagen emissions scandal initially discovered by academic researchers.

+ EPA (the relevant governmental regulatory enforcement body)  enforces based
  on the academic findings.

+ EPA (and other bodies, such as California's regulators) work directly with
  manufacturer to restore compliance.

+ Interesting FAQ on EPA's site at [http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/cert/violations.htm](http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/cert/violations.htm).

# From EPA's FAQ

<hr/>

> Manufacturers are given a reasonable amount of time to develop a plan to complete the repairs, including both the repair procedure and manufacture of any needed parts. Depending on the complexity of the repair and the lead time needed to obtain the necessary components, it could take up to one year to identify corrective actions, develop a recall plan, and issue recall notices.

# Should This Exist?

+ We have societal debate whether regulatory regimes should exist.

+ Libertarians tend to believe they're rarely need.

+ Most others on the political spectrum believe regulatory regimes, and
  regulatory enforcement valuable.

+ Calling for end to copyleft is akin to calling to an end to regulatory
  regime that ensures software freedom.

# Voluntary Compliance &amp; Non-Copyleft

+ Non-copyleft licenses grant basic permissions to copy, modify, and
  redistribute software.

+ These rights are not *guaranteed* by those licenses
     + The licenses (and the communities) merely encourage, but don't
       mandate, sharing of software.

+ Non-copyleft is the Free Software licensing version of libertarianism:
     + for-profit companies exploit the resource &amp; are entrusted for
       voluntary giving back to the commons.
     + I find it almost anarcho-capitalist in practice.

# A Regulatory Regime for Software Sharing

+ Copyleft is admittedly a regulatory regime, designed to meet specific
  policy goals.

+ If you're opposed to any regulatory regimes (e.g., if you think no one
  should have the power to stop VW's emissions trick), then you should
  certainly oppose copyleft.

+ In my experience, most people prefer some regulatory regime to exist to
  control areas of their interest and concern.
     
# The Copyleft

+ Linux and much Open Source and Free Software  use **copyleft** licenses.
    + The GNU General Public License (GPL) is the most common one.

+ Copyleft, simply, seeks to give downstream users the means and capacity to
  generate and utilize binaries in the same manner that upstream did.
    + Even after modifying sources.

# Formal Definition of Copyleft

<hr/>

> Copyleft is a strategy of utilizing copyright law to pursue the policy goal
> of fostering &amp; encouraging the equal &amp; inalienable right to copy,
> share, modify &amp; improve creative works of authorship. Copyleft &hellip;
> describes any method that utilizes the copyright system to achieve the
> aforementioned goal. Copyleft as a concept is usually implemented in the
> details of a specific copyright license &hellip; Copyright holders of
> creative work can unilaterally implement these licenses for their own works
> to build communities that collaboratively share &amp; improve those
> copylefted creative works.

<span class="fitonslide"> <p align=right> &mdash; Definition of copyleft from
copyleft.org </p> </span>

# What is GPL Enforcement?

+ Broadly, GPL enforcement is the process of ensuring that redistributors
  grant the rights that copyleft assures.

+ The primary goals are:
     + ensure that the users of a product containing copylefted works can
       participate upstream by testing, building, and enhancing the work on
       the actual device.
     + help distributor themselves join and contribute back to the upstream
       project.

+ [*The Principles of Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement* at sfconservancy.org/linux-compliance/principles.html](https://sfconservancy.org/linux-compliance/principles.html).

# But It's Not *Really* About Upstream.

+ Nevertheless, enforcement pursues that second goal only indirectly.

+ GPL compliance is usually *not* about what to do upstream.

+ GPL is a license made for the users, not the developers.
     + Who, of course, may be future developers.

+ The main policy goal:
     + Ensure the user can exercise the freedom to modify the software &hellip;
     + &hellip; in a manner that's real and concrete, not theoretical.

# What's a GPL Violation?

+ GPL (both v2 and v3) require:
     + The whole work licensed under GPL.
     + (which means all copyrighted material added must be under
       GPL-compatible licenses.)
     + Complete, Corresponding Source (CCS) of that work provided, under GPL.

+ The licenses terminate upon violation &hellip;
     + &hellip; thus failure to comply means lost distribution rights.
     + &hellip; enforcement uses this rights termination as leverage to
       restore compliance.

# Who Are the Regulators?

+ Copyleft is a community-organized regulatory regime.

+ The authors of the software (i.e., copyright holders) are automatically
  entrusted with enforcement authority.

+ The force of law thus automatically deputizes the authors themselves to
  ensure compliance.

+ The beauty of the legal hack of copyleft goes beyond merely creative use of
  copyright.

# Copyleft Value Proposition for Businesses

+ Most businesses, particularly small ones, don't want anarcho-capitalism.

+ Equitable regulations create equal playing field for innovators.

+ Fairly enforced copyleft licensing ensures equitable regulation software
  freedom principles.

+ Copyleft availability limits first movers' advantage; allows immediate
  leveraging of new innovations.

+ Linux adoption in Android mobile devices is an excellent example.

# Copyleft Value Proposition for Businesses

+ Non-copyleft licensing yields a prisoners' dilemma:
      + if the other guy releases code &amp; I don't, I benefit greatly.
      + if both of us do, we both get maximal benefit.

+ Copyleft licensing &amp; its enforcement creates regulatory process that
  assures the optimal outcome for everyone.


# HP Knows This

<img height="600" width="399" alight="right" src="linxcon-fink.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Martin Fink, CTO of HP, said at LinuxCon Europe earlier this month:
    + &ldquo;I'm calling out that you should change your default to a
      copyleft license like the GPL.&ldquo; Copyleft is good, he added;
      &ldquo;copyleft is what enables community&rdquo;
    +  &ldquo;But I hope that with some more education, people will see the self-governing, overhead-avoiding nature of copyleft, and we can get the pendulum to swing back to copyleft as the industry default.&rdquo;
    + &ldquo;All of you are enabled to change things. You can take an
      Apache-licensed project and go make a GPL version of it. Some of you
      will start new projects. When you do that, start them with the
      GPL.&rdquo;

+ He says this *despite* HP's heavy investment in Apache-licensed projects like OpenStack.

# If It's Just a Symbol &hellip;

+ If GPL is just merely a symbol with no real authority.
     + why bother?
     + We might as well all be using the Apache license.  

+ An unenforced copyleft is the functional equivalent to a non-copyleft license.

<hr/>

> Well, if it’s a symbol, to hell with it.

# Enforcement Must Not Be Corrupt

+ Enforcement is the only process to assure the benefits of copyleft.
     + individuals actors can ignore its requirements if no one watches &amp; regulates.

+ We must learn from the mistakes of other regulatory regimes?

#  Anyone Know Who This Is?

<img height="600" width="399" alight="right" src="linxcon-fink.jpg" align="right"  />

# Banking Regulation Failures

+ Carmen Segarra was a bank examiner for the Federal Reserve in New York who,
  in 2012, started secretly recording the cosy relationship between federal
  regulators and big banks.

+ [*This American Life*, Episode 536](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/536/the-secret-recordings-of-carmen-segarra)
covered her work in detail.

+ Key lesson learned:
       + the free flow of staff &amp; relationship-building between the
         regulators &amp; those they regulate leads to initially subtle
         corruption in selective enforcement which often transforms into
         blatant favoritism &amp; regulatory misconduct.

# The Compliance Industrial Complex

+ As the primary person enforcing the GPL since 1999 &hellip;

+ I've been a major inspiration an industry of lawyers &amp; services &hellip;

+ whose primary goals are: &hellip;
      + scare companies about copyleft software adoption.
      + charge huge fees in an attempt to &ldquo;get their client off&rdquo;
        when they fail to meet copyleft terms.

# The Compliance Industrial Complex

FIXME: VW picture

+ The existing of this compliance industrial complex has made copyleft
  enforcement amazingly expensive.
      + because we aren't a governmental agency, we have no easy source of funding.

+ Instead, Conservancy is a charity, supported by the public, to do the
  public good.

# Who Watches the Watchers?

+ The ancient philosophers asked: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?
      + we should still ask this today.

+ Conservancy is a charity regulated itself by the Internal Revenue Service.
      + we must act in the public good, lest we lose our 501(c)(3) status.

+ Others **do** use enforcement corruptly.
      + I encourage you to ask who is doing the enforcing (and why) when you see it
        in action.
