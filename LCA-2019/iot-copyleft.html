  <h2 class="top-title">The Theme of the Conference</h2>

  <p class="fragment">As a regular attendee, I love when conferences pick themes.</p>
  <p class="fragment">It forces me not to propose the same talk everywhere.</p>
</section>
  <section>
  <h2 class="top-title">The Theme of the Conference</h2>
  <p class="fragment">I promise at least 51% of this talk is &ldquo;new content&rdquo;.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Hey, for a guy who strives to stay &ldquo;on
  message&rdquo; as much as I can, &ldquo;slim majority new content&rdquo; really the best I can do.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Talk Thesis</h2>

  <p class="fragment">I seek to convince you the first step toward mitigating
  the many of the dangers of IoT (Internet of Things) start with a
  regularly and fairly enforced copyleft license.</p>
</section>
<section>

  <h2 class="top-title">Consensus that IoT is Dangerous</h2>

  <p>The joke of this conference&hellip; <span class="fragment">which I've
      seen told in at least three other talks:</span></p>
  <p class="fragment">The S in IoT stands for security.</p></section>

  <h2 class="top-title">So?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">As good as technical communities are at identifying
    problems, we too often fail to take measure to solve them.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Linux, historically, was the ultimate
    counter-example.</p></section>

  <h2 class="top-title">Why Is Linux on your Laptop?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Specifically, the hobbyist culture brought Linux to the
    laptop <strong>in spite of</strong>, not <strong>through</strong> the manufactures.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Who Put Linux on your Laptop?</h2>

  <p class="fragment">Did your laptop come with Linux?</p>
  <p class="fragment">Have you tried to buy a laptop with Linux preinstalled
    lately?</p>
  <p class="fragment">It's only slightly easier than it was in 1992.</p></section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">What Devices Have Linux Preinstalled?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">So, if laptops rarely have Linux pre-installed, where
  is Linux most commonly preinstalled?</p>

  <p class="fragment">For many years, no other product line of IoT devices
    had a serious alternative firmware project.</p></section>

  <h2 class="top-title">The BusyBox Lawsuits</h2>

  <p class="fragment">Before IoT was even a term, the goal of BusyBox
    enforcement was about downstream users with would-be IoT devices!</p>

<h2 class="top-title">Who Does Upstream Serve?</h2>

<p class="fragment">Linux upstream is too often focused on the big corporate
  users.</p>

<p class="fragment">Multiple key member of the Linux leadership once said to
    me: <q>All I want from the GPL is their best .c files; I don't care if it
    builds or installs</q>.</p>

  <h4 class="top-title">Garrett: It's About Downstream Users Who Become Developers</h4>
  
  <br/>
<q align="right" cite="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2016-August/003585.html">
  [D]o you want 4 more enterprise clustering filesystems, or another complete
rewrite of the page allocator for a 3% performance improvement under a
specific database workload, or do you want a bunch of teenagers who grow up
hacking this stuff because it's what powers every device they own? Because
honestly I think it's the latter that's helped get you [Linux developers]
where you are now, and they're not going to be there if the thing that
matters to you most is making sure that large companies don't feel threatened
rather than making sure that the next 19 year old in a dorm room can actually
hack the code on their phone and build something better as a result. It's
what brought me here in the first place, and I'm hardly the only one.
<p align="right"> &mdash; Matthew Garrett, Linux Developer, 26 August 2016</p>

</section>  


<section>
<h2 class="top-title">Copyleft is About Users</h2>

<p class="fragment">Matthew is right: the hobbyist firmware modifier and the
  would-be developer really do matter most.</p>

<p class="fragment">Would we even <em>have</em> any new upstream developers if
  the only place you can reinstall Linux yourself is in a big data center or
  in a Cloud host?</p>

<p class="fragment">We may have won the DIY battle on the laptop, but we're
  losing it on IoT!</p></section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Linux is Important</h2>

  <p class="fragment">There is no doubt in my mind that Linux is the most
    important GPL'd program in history.</p>

  <p class="fragment">It was successful <em>because</em> users could install
    it on their own devices.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Linux cannot remain the most important GPL'd program if
    users can't install their modifications.</p>
  <p class="fragment"><strong>Tinkering is what makes software freedom succeed.</strong></p></section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">The Need For Downstream</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Upstream matters, of course, but downstream matters more.</p>
  <p class="fragment">There may be thousands of Linux upstream developers
    now, but&hellip;</p></section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">2 Billion Android Devices!</h2>
<img src="img/2-billion-android.png"/>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Downstream &amp; Upstream Won't Agree 100%</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Linux upstream is important to us; they're our friends
    and colleagues.</p>
  <p class="fragment">A silent plurality and a loud minority agree about the
    importance of software freedom for the individual downstream user.</p>
  <p class="fragment">&amp; the upstream developers have  kindly licensed
    their code in a manner that <strong>does assure our software
      freedom</strong>.</p>
  <p class="fragment">We just need to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Freedom Isn't Free as In Price</h2>
  <p class="fragment">No, we don't need to fight a revolution to liberate
    IoT devices&hellip;</p>
  <p class="fragment">&hellip; because the words are there, right in the GPL, that assures
    us the ability to reinstall and modify the base operating system of all
    our firmwares.</p>
  <p class="fragment">We just need to take it.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">What You Can Do</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Request Linux sources on every device you own.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Try to build and install them; if you can't, ask a
    friend or ask Conservancy to help.</p>
  <p class="fragment">If it doesn't build/install, it's a GPL violation;
  report it to Conservancy (&lt;compliance@sfconservancy.org&gt;).</p>
  <p class="fragment">Step up as a leader of a project for devices that
    matter to you.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Why This Will Work</h2>
  <p class="fragment">The problem seems insurmountable now, only because
    we've been led astray.</p>
 <p class="fragment">The right to upgrade IoT devices is guaranteed to you as
   a Linux licensee, by the license that upstream Linux gave you.</p>
  <p class="fragment">You just have to exercise your rights.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Why This Will Work</h2>
    <p class="fragment">Rebuilding and reinstalling Linux on IoT device is
      the first and absolutely necessary step toward privacy and security on
      those devices.</p>
 <p class="fragment">When the user controls the operating system again, the
   balance of power <strong>will be restored</strong>.</p></section>
