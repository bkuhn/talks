  <h2 class="top-title">Previously On <em>The OpenWRT Summit</em>&hellip;</h2>

  <p><span class="fragment">I spoke two years ago</span>
    <span class="fragment">&hellip; about the history of copyleft &amp; the GPL.</span></p>
  <p class="fragment">And, in particular, how OpenWRT is so central to that history.</p></section>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Still A Daily Inspiration</h2>

<img align=right src="openwrt-history-page.png"/>

<p class="fragment">More than 15 years ago, SVN check-in r1 of the OpenWrt
  project was the actual source code we reviewed in the Cisco/Linksys GPL
  compliance efforts.</p></section>

  <h2 class="top-title">Still Wondering If We Made Mistakes</h2>

<p class="fragment">Was it a mistake not to sue Broadcom for their proprietary
  Linux driver?</p>

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">The Anti-GPL Enforcement Era</h2>
  <p class="fragment">GPL violations are more prevalent than ever.</p>
  <p class="fragment">GPL enforcement became a more divisive issue upstream
    in the last two years.</p>
  <p class="fragment">In fact, the political firestorm erupted just months
    after my OpenWRT Summit 2016 talk.</p> 
</section>

<section class="copious">
<h2 class="top-title">Should Enforcement Ever Happen?</h2>
<p>When asked by David Woodhouse:
<q>If you are happy with the status quo, and do not want violators to be brought into compliance &hellip;</q></p>

<br clear="all">

<p class="fragment">
  Greg K. H. answered:
<q>I do, but I don't ever think that suing them is the right way to do it,
given that we have been <strong><em>very</em> successful so far without having to do
    that</strong>.</q>

 <p>But, our community <em>did</em> often enforce the GPL.</p>

 <p class="fragment">&amp; it's been necessary for Linux's success since the
   advent of the embedded system.</p>
 <p class="fragment">OpenWRT is the ready-made example of that.</p>

  <h2 class="top-title">After Linksys, there were a lot of lawsuits</h2>

  <p class="fragment" align="left">Harald Welte from 2004&ndash;2013 brought
    more than 15 GPL enforcement actions (most of which were lawsuits) and mostly against
    wireless router makers:</p>

<h2 class="top-title">GPL Is Not Primarily About Upstream</h2>

<section>
<h2 class="top-title">GPL Is Not Primarily About Upstream</h2>

<p class="fragment">Rob and I spoke at LCA in 2017.  We cleared up this
  misunderstanding.</p>

<p class="fragment">Upstreamed code is only
  a <strong>secondary</strong> effect of copyleft's primary goal:
<span class="fragment">rights to downstream users so they can
  someday become upstream developers.</span></p>

  <h4 class="top-title">Garrett: It's About Downstream Users Who Become Developers</h4>
  
  <br/>
<q align="right" cite="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2016-August/003585.html">
  [D]o you want 4 more enterprise clustering filesystems, or another complete
rewrite of the page allocator for a 3% performance improvement under a
specific database workload, or do you want a bunch of teenagers who grow up
hacking this stuff because it's what powers every device they own? Because
honestly I think it's the latter that's helped get you [Linux developers]
where you are now, and they're not going to be there if the thing that
matters to you most is making sure that large companies don't feel threatened
rather than making sure that the next 19 year old in a dorm room can actually
hack the code on their phone and build something better as a result. It's
what brought me here in the first place, and I'm hardly the only one.

<section>
  <h2 class="top-title">Our History is Enforcement</h2>

  <p>I argue: Linux and other GPL'd software has been
    successful <em>because</em> enforcement and lawsuits have happened
    regularly since 2002.</p>

  <p class="fragment">We can't run a parallel experiment (absent 
  time travel).</p>
  
  <p class="fragment">But, we can show it's political FUD to argue that GPL
  enforcement and occasional lawsuits is a new-fangled strategy
  that endangers Linux.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Because, if so, Linux has been &ldquo;endangered&rdquo; since 2002.</p>
</section>
<section class="copious">
  <h4 class="top-title">The Principles of Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Our primary goal in GPL enforcement is to bring about GPL compliance.</li>

  <li class="fragment highlight-green">Legal action is a last
  resort. Compliance actions are primarily education and assistance processes
  to aid those who are not following the license.</li>

  <li>Confidentiality can increase receptiveness and responsiveness.</li>

  <li>Community-oriented enforcement must never prioritize financial
    gain.</li>
  <li>Community-oriented compliance work does not request nor accept payment
    to overlook problems.</li>
  <li>Community-oriented compliance work starts with carefully verifying
    violations and finishes only after a comprehensive analysis. </li>
  <li>Community-oriented compliance processes should extend the benefit of
    GPLv3-like termination, even for GPLv2-only works.</li>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">The .01% We Don't Agree On</h3>

  <p>Greg KH and I agree on 99.99% of GPL enforcement strategy.  </p>

  <p class="fragment">We differ only on one minor point.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Lawsuits</h3>

  <p>Companies sue each other all time: there are hundreds of lawsuits
    between tech companies every year.</p>

  <p class="fragment"> We can't even overcount to get 50 lawsuits filed by
  community actors against GPL violators in history.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Yet, we remain under constant political attack because
    Conservancy has funded <em>exactly one</em> Linux lawsuit: <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/vmware-lawsuit-faq.html">Christoph
    Hellwig's ongoing case against VMware</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4 class="top-title">Just so we're clear: This Is What We Care About</h4>
  
  <p>The accusation is: Conservancy cares more about copyleft than
    Linux.</p>
  <p class="fragment">The FUD implication: we want to &ldquo;sacrifice
    Linux at the holy altar of the GPL.&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4 class="top-title">Just so we're clear: This Is What We Care About</h4>
  <p class="fragment">Linux is a bunch of code and copyrights that happen to
    be GPL'd; the GPL is just a tool (by design).</p>

  <p class="fragment">Code and licenses are ephemeral.  We
  care about is users' long-term software freedom.</p>

  <p class="fragment">New developers should hack their devices &amp;
  join our community.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">The Curious Case of OpenWRT</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Wireless routers were the canary in the coalmine: the
  first product beyond servers that <em>needed</em> Linux.</p>
  <p class="fragment">As IoT becomes common, every product, software-wise,
    actually looks more like a wireless router than anything else.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Can we, and should we, establish a beachhead for users
    with wireless routers?</p></section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">What It Would Take</h3>
  <p class="fragment">We'd need OpenWRT developers to commit long-term to GPL
    enforcement.</p>
  <p class="fragment">We'd need some of you to volunteer some time to work
    with Conservancy to check source releases.</p>
  <p class="fragment">We'd need a plan on what to do when they refuse to
    release code (because someone will).</p></section>

<section>
  <h4 class="top-title">Enforcement's More Work Than It Should Be</h4>

  <p class="fragment">We at Conservancy don't actually <em>like</em> GPL
    enforcement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">It's boring.</li>
    <li class="fragment">It's politically dangerous for our careers and our organization.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Speaking for just me, I'd actually rather be a
      developer.</li>
    <li class="fragment">We do it because it benefits developers and users.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">So, I'm Asking, Not Telling</h3>
  <p class="fragment">I've read OpenWRT forums and see users complaining
  about compliance problems (as recently as a few months ago).</p>
  <p class="fragment">It doesn't surprise me.</p>
  <p class="fragment">There are probably even more violations!</p>
  <p class="fragment">But, I want to know from <strong>you</strong> if you
    want Conservancy's help to do something about it.</p>
