# My Two Roles

+ President and Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ On Borad of Directors of the FSF.

+ This talk's about the important things the two orgs have in common.

# Some GNU History

+ GNU Manifesto, 1985

+ RMS writes in *GNU Manifesto*:
      - *"All sorts of development can be funded with a Software Tax"*
      - *"People with new ideas could distribute programs as [free software], asking for donations from satisfied users"*

# Why Doesn't FSF Hire Programmers Now?

+ GNU packages now maintained by volunteers (from FSF's view)

+ The volunteers are paid for by for-profits
     - Red Hat, Codesourcery, etc.
     - even Canonical, believe it or not, GRUB maintainer works there

+ FSF remains a non-profit home:
    - provides oversight & ensures software freedom
    - copyright assignment

# Non-Profit vs. For-Profit

+ For-profits act in interest in shareholders.

+ 501(c)(3) Non-profits act in interest of the public good.

+ Software freedom is best when in public good.

+ Non-profit orgs (NPOs) are best place for software freedom.

# What Can NPOs Do?

+ Collect (USA-tax-deductible) donations for a project.

+ Distribute that money to advance project (and public good).

+ Make sure project isn't controlled by for-profit interests.

+ Help leadership with non-technical decisions.

# Organization Proliferation

+ Too many NPOs will confuse donors.

+ Need a board of directors, incorporation, meetings, IRS filings.

+ Hackers end up doing work they hate.

+ Less Free Software gets written.

# Aggregating Under Umbrella

+ Conservancy is designed as one organization.

+ Composed of many different projects.

+ Each has its own funds.

+ One board of directors, one non-technical governance structure.

# Directed Funding Through Conservancy 

+ Travel to conferences.

+ Handling Google SoC.

+ Conference invoicing and contracts.

+ Stipends for developers.

+ Fiscal oversight.
