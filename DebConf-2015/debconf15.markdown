# First Things First.

+ I'm honored to be here.
     + I'm not just saying that, I don't say that at any old conference.

+ It's my third DebConf (attended DebConf1, regular track talk at DebConf10, and now here as Invited Speaker.

+ In the simplest terms: I'm a fan and user of Debian: I **love** your
  project.

# It's This Simple!

<img align="right" src="aut_9626.jpg" width="360" height="480"/>

+ Debian is special.

+ It's thrived for so long.

+ It's governance is democratic: almost unique among Free Software projects.

+ It has stayed staunchly non-commercial since its inception.

# DebConf 1

<img align="right" src="2001-debconf-bkuhn-tbm_Lg.jpg" width="450" height="481"/>

+ At Debconf 1 in 2001:

+ I still dressed pretty casually to conferences back then.
     + &hellip; so that changed: I'm not &ldquo;in short trousers&rdquo; anymore.

+ OTOH, Martin **still** does look at me like I have no idea what I'm talking
about most of the time.

+ Most importantly, what hasn't changed is the ethos of contributors. 

# Morality of the Hobbyist Contributor

+ IMO, Debian is a project comprised first of people:
     + &hellip; who care enough to do what's right for others.
     + &hellip; who **volunteer** to do that.

+ Volunteers continue to believe this one fundamental tenant of software freedom development:
     + I'm a Debian contributor **first** &hellip;
     + &hellip; and an employee of my company **second**

+ I do this because I love being part of a community that thinks this way.
     + &hellip; and interacting with those who care.

# Debian as a charitable endeavor

+ Early Debian was an FSF project once up on a time!

+ Debian now has &ldquo;trusted charities&rdquo; around the world:
      + Software in the Public Interest (SPI)
      + FFIS
      + Debian France
      + DebConf e.V.
      + debian.ch

+ &hellip; &amp; makes other partnerships with charities too (more on that in
a few minutes).

# From Our Humble Beginnings

+ Now, when I was at DebConf 1, I was the Executive Director of the FSF (the org of GNU).
       + (John Sullivan (who's here at DebConf 15) has that job now.

+ FSF was and isn't big, by most standards.

+ Strictly, speaking it was professional (in the sense that people got paid).
       + but I don't think that's what Linus meant.

+ In fact, I think what Linus meant is he wanted a project that was what GNU and Debian have always been:
       + a project run by individual enthusiasts, not hired guns and companies.

+ Thus, the charitable tendencies of GNU, FSF, Debian, and (more recently)
  SPI and Conservancy were perfect fit for creating democratic, developer-run
  community projects.

# How Linux Has Changed

+ Yet, in so many projects, technical and political governance are now bifurcated.

+ Linux's governance is primarily via industrial trade-associations.
     + Not to say many Linux developers don't have that old ethic.

+ But companies, not individuals, control organizational structure around Linux.
     + Companies and their trade-associations gate-keep governance decisions.
     + Many developers feel disenfranchised.
     
+ Conservancy (where I work) helps mitigate that.

# Conservancy's GPL Enforcement

+ Software Freedom Conservancy (and other charities, like SPI and FSF) do &hellip;
       + &hellip; for the hobbyist developer &hellip;
       + &hellip; the morally right, and sometimes controversial tasks
       + &hellip; that developers need, but companies and trade associations never do.

+ For Linux, Conservancy enforces the GPL, because companies and trade associations *won't*.
       + It's just not in their business interest.

+ As I said at DebConf10: Debian has been a shining example of commitment to
  copyleft.

# VMware Suit Draws Battle Lines

<img align="right" src="dark-times-dumbledore.jpg" width="472" height="554"/>

+ Conservancy is funding Christoph to sue VMware in Germany for violating the GPL.
       + No, sadly, I can't give you more details than are already in the FAQ
         on our website.

+ Renewed enforcement over Linux has changed much:
       + the for-profit industry and trade associations want to eradicate copyleft.
       + A personal commitment to copyleft, and willingness to act to defend
         it, has become more politically treacherous than ever before.

+ Copyleft's political opponents see the chinks in our armor and will exploit it.

# Even Debian's Downstreams Violate GPL

+ Ubuntu's trademark policy violated GPL for over 2 years.
       + FSF and Conservancy worked arduously to resolve it.

+ The resolution reached yields GPL compliance via a trump clause.

+ Non-copylefted software in Ubuntu is **effectively proprietarized** by
  their policy.

# Debian Matters!

<img align="right" src="keystone_01.png" width="480" height="273"/>

+ Debian **is** the strongest non-commercial upstream distribution.
     - Debian's insulated from pressure because of its long independent history. 
     - But that pressure **is** coming to you.

+ Canonical, Ltd.'s proprietarization of Debian (and GPL violations before
  that) are the harbinger of more to come.

+ Debian is the keystone of Free Software.
     - It's the building blocks that other projects use.

# What Is Debian?

+ I said earlier: Debian is about the people.
     - That's what I truly believe.

+ But, I've (sadly) spent more of my time since DebConf 1 around lawyers (and
  business people) than developers. 

+ How do *they* see Debian?
     - In terms of its assets (e.g., copyrights), not its people.

+ They're right, of course, but what are they missing?
     - That people can leverage those assets for a good cause.

# What Is Copyleft?

+ One way to view copyleft is:
     - A mechanism to leverage assets that *shouldn't* exist (and therefore no one
       should control) to maximize fair treatment to others.
     - c.f.: ,<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html"><cite>Freedom
       or Power?</cite></a>, my essay co-written with RMS in 2001.

+ Thus, copyleft uses the tools of the oppressor to stop oppression.

+ Which means we have to consider every tool in the arsenal that they use
  against us.

+ How can Debian better utilize these tools?

# Announcing: Debian Copyright Aggregation Project

+ The Debian Copyright Aggregation Project:
     - is a program of Software Freedom Conservancy (begun with permission from SPI).
     - permits individuals to optionally &amp; configurably assign  copyright
       to Conservancy to Debian-related works.
     - permits individuals to designate Conservancy as their copyleft
       enforcement agent.
     - provides Debian with licensing support and advice on an ongoing basis
       with a formal commitment.
     - exists b/c a key Debian contributor asked us to (more in a few moments).

# Copyright Assignment?!?!?

# Using CAA's for Good

+ For-profit companies *do* love &copy;AA's
      - &amp; heavy-weight rights-transfer CLA's (roughly same as &copy;AA's)
      - again, they use it as a means of control &amp; to proprietarize.

+ We should use that tool for good:
      - only assign to charities with a stated mission to uphold copyleft for
        software freedom.
      - plus, Debian will always be multi-copyright held no matter what.

+ There are simple (admittedly sad) reasons this might be a good idea:

# Surprising Changes Happen

+ It's a fact that people die.

+ or just generally: people forget to take care of things they care about
  that aren't urgent.

+ Copyleft violations are so prevalent that it's hard for any one of them to
  be urgent.
       - If you care about copyleft, then holding your own copyrights are
       *both* a privilege *and* a burden.

+ For those who feel burdened, it's here for you.

+ Don't be ashamed to want to unburden yourself &amp; ask Conservancy to
help, after all &hellip;

# Zack is the first

<img align="right" src="zacchiroli.png" width="264" height="32"/>


+ Dr. Stefano &ldquo;Zack&rdquo; Zacchiroli, former DPL, was the first to
  sign up.

+ Zack has assigned *all* his copyrights in Debian, past and future, to
  Software Freedom Conservancy, as of yesterday.

# Zack is why!

<img align="right" src="zack-small.png" width="190" height="239"/>

+ In fact, Zack was the one who asked us to do this in the first place.

# Zack isn't alone.

<img align="right" src="paultag.jpeg" width="486" height="486"/>

+ Paul Tagliamonte (paultag) has assigned a few (not all) of his Debian works to
  Conservancy via the configurable &copy;AA.

+ Others are considering planning to assign, including Asheesh Laroia and
  Clint Adams (who is otherwise extremely &amp; correctly anti-CAA/CLA).

# But, if you still hate CAA

+ Conservancy also uses enforcement agreements already in use for Samba,
BusyBox, and the GPL Compliance Project for Linux Developers.

+ Similar enforcement agreements are available for Debian contributors who
want Conservancy to enforce copyleft on their behalf, but don't want
copyright assigned.
      - These can be canceled with 30 days' notice.

+ You can sign any of these agreements right here at DebConf!

# What Else Does Debian Get?

+ Conservancy has agreed to offer regular licensing and policy advice and
  expertise on a monthly basis.

+ At least four hours/month will be pro bono (no charge to Debian project).

+ Debian can rely on Conservancy to help with licensing issues for the long
term.

+ I and Karen Sandler are two of the foremost experts on Free Software
  licensing, and are excited to provide this service to Debian.


# What More Can I Say?

+ Awkward alert: I apologize in advance if I get emotional, but:

+ As a personal matter, for years I've wanted to give back to Debian, which
  has given me so much.

+ I admittedly haven't used Debian throughout my life.
      + from 1992-present: SLS &rarr; Slackware &rarr; Red Hat Linux &rarr; Debian (slink, potato) &rarr; Ubuntu &rarr; <a href="http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2010/01/14/ubuntu-debian.html">Debian</a> (etch &amp; beyond).
      + &hellip; but Debian is where I want to stay.

+ Thank all of you for everything that you have given me with Debian.

+ Ask me for anything that I can do to help Debian.
      + But I hope the Debian Copyright Aggregation Project from Conservancy
        is a good start.
