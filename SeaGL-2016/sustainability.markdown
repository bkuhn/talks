# Isn't This Sustainability?

<hr/>

# Sustainability: What They Mean

+ I was invited to a secret invite-only meeting to discuss Open Source Sustainability.
     - but had a scheduling conflict.

+ My colleague Karen Sandler went instead.

+ I've asked her multiple times, so what do all these people mean by
&ldquo;We need to work on Open Source Sustainability&rdquo;

+ She says: &ldquo;I was there the whole time.  I listened to everything everyone said.  &amp; I  still don't know&rdquo;

# What Most Sustainability Advocates Say.

+ They mostly talk about making sure that the &ldquo;core&rdquo; is funded.

+ They are usually talking about relatively young (1-6 years old) projects.

+ They talk about &ldquo;optimizing for collaboration&rdquo;.
      + with those new people who are &ldquo;bringing a lot to the table&rdquo;.

+ What do they say they're bringing?

# It's All About the Money

+ We've gotten far too comfortable with the flow of funding from large companies.

+ Wait, does that mean I'm anti-corporate?
      + No, of course not.
      + This is about equality of individual developers with companies that engage with software freedom.
      + &amp; creating alternative institutions &amp; structures that don't
        rely so heavily on the largess of large krypton's.

# The Final Goal

<hr/>

> IMO, the final goal of the software freedom movement is to change the world
> so that all software available is Free Software, giving every users those
> key inalienable rights.

# From Our Humble Beginnings

+ FSF was then (&amp; isn't now, IMO) *big*, by the relative standards of the time.

+ Strictly speaking, it was professional (in the sense that it paid employees).
       + but I don't think that's what Linus meant.
       + IMO, he meant: organized by individual enthusiasts, not &ldquo;hired
         guns&rdquo; &amp; companies.

# Commerce in Software

+ I'm from a software world that predates venture capital interest in software.
     + People used to start business in the &ldquo;normal way&rdquo; in
       software once upon a time.

+ What's the normal way?
     + Ask your favorite local restaurant or pub how they got started.
     + Even if it is a chain (i.e., might be a franchise), it was started
       with personal debt and working on the side while having a
       &ldquo;normal job&rdquo;.

+ The best stuff starts from the hobbyists &amp; enthusiasts making something
that people want to eventually pay for.

# How Did That Work Historically

+ Consider two projects: Linux &amp; Samba
   + Both founded in the early 1990s.
   + Both were founded by people who didn't have a business plan or business interest.
   + Eventually, they both became commercially important.
   + Eventually, people started to pay Linux &amp; Samba devlopers to work on
     their project.
   + Eventually, they became industry standards that were a default choice to
     include in products.

+ The projects, in particular, were born to bring freedom in areas of non-freeness.

# Old Days: xdm, Solaris and NIS+

+ I once chased a bug from xdm, down through NIS+ to the Solaris kernel

+ Sun told me my company was &ldquo;too small&rdquo; to get it fixed.

+ It's one of the experiences that made me sure I never wanted to rely on
  non-Free Software ever again.

+ Who does this happen to anymore?
    + (almost) no one!
    + Why?

# How Things Were Different 

+ How many of you are not kernel developers?

+ Have you ever found a bug that caused you to have to look at kernel source code?

# Ok, So You Don't Use Linux 

+ Do you use a Mac?

+ Have you ever found a bug while using MacOS that you

# Software Just Got Better

+ In 20 years, all software got better (both proprietary and free).

+ But all software got more complex.

+ The layers of proprietarization got thinner.

# What the License Says Matters

<img src="google-guardian-article.png" align="center" />

# Avoiding Proprietary Software

<hr/>

> For some time now, this paradoxical principle appears to hold: *each day*
> day, more lines of freely licensed code exist than ever before in human
> history; yet, it also becomes increasingly more difficult *each day* for
> users to successfully avoid proprietary software while completing their
> necessary work on a computer.

# Why Things Changed?

+ So, there is both growingly more and growingly less software freedom on a
  daily basis.

+ The default funding model to Open Source is *big companies* invest in the projects they
  *want* to see in the world.

+ Historically, the default was that a project that was a succeeding for
  hobbyist and small businesses gained *interest* from big companies who
  needed to respect to the community standards of that existing community.

# How Things Have Changed

+ Furthermore, in so many projects, technical and political governance are now
  bifurcated.

+ *Technical* governance often remains under developer control.

+ *Political* governance (including licensing, legal &amp; policy decisions)
  are primarily controlled by computer industry trade associations.

# Why Did We Suddenly Need Sustainability?

+ It's an odd consideration that we hear warnings of lack of sustainability
  from the same people who say &ldquo;Open Source has won&rdquo;.

+ What made it unsustainable?

+ Why did political governance get separated? 

# How It's Unsustainable

+ [HP's Martin Fink said it best in November 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxIEDNyZOkA):

    + [&ldquo;Complexities about what makes Open Source work get lost&rdquo;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxIEDNyZOkA#t=11m05s)
    +  [&ldquo;The problem that we're dealing with is some people are still uncomfortable with copyleft and the notion of &ldquo;share &amp; share alike &hellip; or reciprocity.&rdquo;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxIEDNyZOkA#t=19m47s)
    + [&ldquo; Don't fear copyleft, it's a good thing.&rdquo;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxIEDNyZOkA#t=20m42s)
    +  &ldquo;I fear what's happening to open source; we're enabling the very world we're trying to undo (by favoring non-copyleft)&rdquo;
    + &ldquo;Permissive licenses incentivize corporate actors to fracture those communities with proprietary forks.  Then we have to spend time participating.&rdquo;

# How It's Unsustainable

+ HP's Martin Fink said it best in November 2015 (con't):
    + &ldquo;There's a choice you're making about how much work it takes to create a community.  Non-copyleft communities have a significant amount of bureaucratic overhead.&rdquo;
    + &ldquo;If you don't have a copyleft license, you need additional governance
      infrastructure to ensure collaboration. &hellip; Working groups now get
      created to figure out how to make sure companies engage in ways that work
      with the community.&rdquo;
    + &ldquo;The problem is the default is permissive.  My call out to all of is change
  the default to copyleft.&rdquo;
    + &ldquo;Copyleft is good.  Copyleft is not evil.  It brings a sense of
      community.&rdquo;

# Anti-Copyleft Rhetoric Remains Strong

+ Today, in Conservancy's booth, a former Microsoft employee came by to say:
    + GPL promotes socialism.
    + GPL is anti-business.

+ Ok, so is this just usual rhetoric or is there a strategy here?

+ Yes, the strategy is to control governance through some other means that
  licenses naturally organized.

# On Requirement By License

<img src="Constitution.jpg" align="right"  />

+ GPL == Constitution of Software Freedom.
     + a &ldquo;written down&rdquo; embodiment of core principles.

+ GPL's a detailed implementation of the four freedoms:
     + freedom to run and study.
     + freedom to improve.
     + freedom to share.
     + freedom to share improvements.

# Controlling Governance

<span class="fitonslide">

Politics &hellip; refers to achieving and exercising **positions of
governance** &mdash; organized control over a human community.

# The Buzzword of Governance

+ This phrase itself is used with vastly different meanings in FLOSS.

+ Governance in FLOSS circles can mean:
      - what licensing your project requires for upstreaming (rarely means that anymore).
      - how technical decisions are made.
      - how **companies** exploit FLOSS (particularly what licenses they **ban**).

+ Who is in charge of governance?

# Unelected Incumbent Power Structure

+ The advent of the for-profit corporate &ldquo;Open Source office&rdquo;.

+ Ostensibly, their mission is to manage interaction with FLOSS.
      - BTW, isn't &ldquo;community management&rdquo; a NewSpeak sort of phrase?

+ Really, these are the incumbent leadership.
      - Many of them were once FLOSS activists.
      - Some of them still model their roles as such.
      - But they are inside the system.

# Unelected Incumbent Power Structure

+ Their tactic mission:
      - Exploit volunteer labor (cf: Audrey's keynote) for the Company.
      - Control policy, procedures and the ultimate power structure of FLOSS.

# Really, Be Obsessed with Licensing

+ The power structure is, again, who controls the copyrights.

+ Companies promulgate CLAs &copy;AAs.
       - the goal of such agreements is to give **all the power** to the Company.

+ Turn FLOSS contribution into a one-click-through omnibus, rights-shifting
  agreement only Apple or Facebook could love.

+ The so-called &ldquo;Post Open Source&rdquo; no-licensing meme is in
  service of that messaging.

# So Sustainability?

+ I believe the question of sustainability is coming up *because* we've
  rejected discussions about licenses as constitutions.

+ People have read the FLOSS community as anarchy when it was already a
  representative republic.

+ Throw in a link to insisting &ldquo;VC-level financial viability or
  bust&rdquo;, and you've got the makings of a complete rejection of existing
  software freedom values.

# Slow Growth is the Most Sustainable

+ Never in history has Silicon Valley bubble-centric, 10x growth been
  sustainable.

+ The so-called &ldquo;Open Source has won&rdquo; boom of course can't be
  sustained; we shouldn't even try.

+ Let's think about making structures, systems, licenses and institutions
  that are sustainable for the next fifty years, not the next five.
