# Who Am I?

+ President and Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ A 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charity dedicated to promoting, advancing, defending, and developing Free, Libre and Open Source Software.

+ I used to be software developer.

# I Doth Protest Too Much.

+ I really used to be a software developer.
      + Last project I worked on actively was a an <a href="http://gna.org/projects/pokersource/">online poker system in Python</a>, using Twisted.

+ The reason I care about any of this is I want developers to have the freedom to write Free Software.

+ What does that mean today?

+ How do we go about it?

# Hacking Organizations

+ I focus now on structures and centers for non-profit Free Software development.

+ Like software development, difficulties are in the details, not the general ideas.

+ My job: solve these details to help Free Software projects.

# How Projects Start?

+ Projects start roughly one of two ways:
    + company throws it over the wall.
    + an individual or group of volunteers who love it.

+ &ldquo;Throw it over the wall&rdquo; has limited interest to/interaction with 501(c)(3) non-profits.
    + 501(c)(6)'s are a better home (e.g., OpenStack).
    + Reasons are probably off-topic.

+ Conservancy is focused on helping the &hellip;
    + &hellip; ragtag band of volunteers who want the project to succeed.

# Measure of Success?

+ I'd be fool if I argued we don't need for-profit company support for Free Software.

+ We do.

+ The question is about who is in the drivers' seat in Free Software projects.

# The Hidden Free Software Funding System

+ Shortly put: &ldquo;hackers find a way&rdquo;

+ Developers who care about projects find a way to code give back.
     + &hellip; or they quit and find a better place to work.
     + <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5932586/make-work-feel-less-like-work-with-the-8020-rule">HP's 20% time idea (adopted most famously by Google)</a> capitalizes on this to attract talent.

+ But it's harder than it looks.

# A Portrait of the Free Software Artist&hellip;

+ Free Software developers face constant cognitive dissonance.

+ Their patrons want the code bent to their will &hellip;
     + &hellip; and it's tough not to oblige.

+ This is our community's version of the tragedy of the commons.

# Charities as a Counterbalance

+ I have the pleasure of very little cognitive dissonance.

+ I serve one master and one master only:
     + the public good.

+ I want developers to limit that cognitive dissonance, too.

# How This Relates To Fundraising?

+ Free Software won't exist without funding from companies.

+ But that's not the only place funding should come from.

+ Non-profits can be a hub of funding.

# Practicing What I'm Preaching

+ Right now, Conservancy has:
      + active contracts with seven contributors to &hellip;
      + &hellip; Mercurial, PyPy, and twisted projects.

+ They're paid by the hour to work on Free Software.

+ Their &ldquo;boss&rdquo; is the community of users:
      + they must blog monthly on their work.
      + &amp; send me a public commit log before I release payment on their invoice.

+ This is a great way to get Free Software ought to be developed.

# Where's the Money come from?

+ Example: PyPy

+ Wait, the majority are from for profit companies?

+ Didn't I just get through saying we should avoid that?

+ Well, it's complicated.

# The IRS is Awesome!

+ For international audience: the IRS is USA's &ldquo;Mr. Tax Man&rdquo;

+ But, they're also in charge of charities filings.

+ 501(c)(3) charities are effectively a gov't grant, in two ways:
      + the orgs pay no taxes.
      + donors get a tax deduction.

+ IRS is the regulatory body.

# IRS' Public Support Test

+ No company (nor group thereof) can control a 501(c)(3) charity.
      + for obvious &ldquo;tax evasion&rquo; reasons.

+ A charity can't legally promise a company to do its bidding.

+ Donations from companies **must** be spent in the public good.
      + under penalty of loosing charity status.

+ It's The best darn corporation-control firewall we have for Free Software!

# Why Don't We Do More?

+ Well, even Conservancy's largest projects &hellip;
      + &hellip; (and PyPy is one of the largest) &hellip; 
      + have <= $100k/year throughput.

+ Conservancy's entire revenue (30-some projects!) is only $1.7mil.

+ These numbers don't change the world (alone).

+ The provide that counterbalance I talked about.

# Why Don't We Do More?

<img height="496" width="589" src="pypy-donations.png" align="right" />

+ This is the only fundraising pitch.

+ But I'd love to see more blue in this graph &hellip;
      + &hellip; &amp; every other Conservancy's project graph.

+ We need a culture where people give a little cash from their pocket back to the projects they love.

+ We don't want the teat of for-profit largess to be our only safety net.

+ And, frankly, more companies should be giving back cash too, rather than just staff time.

# Why Don't We Do More?

+ My walk through PyCon tradeshow floor last year was enlightening &hellip;
       + &hellip; I'd never before seen a tradeshow floor focused almost exclusively on recruiting before.

+ It's clear good Python hackers have low unemployment.
       + supply &amp; demand will leave them well-paid.

+ Non-profits don't pay that much.

+ Conservancy has lost contractors to places like:
       + Facebook, consulting companies, &amp; even trade associations.

+ Developers have a choice to make, too:
       + What matters more in your life &hellip;
       + &hellip; who your master is or how much you make?

# Where Do We Go From Here?

+ Growth in non-profits never works like VC-funded companies.

+ Adding an employee or two a year is actually really fast growth.

+ That's the path Conservancy is on.

+ I'd love to see other non-profits funding development &hellip;
     + &hellip; despite the political complexity.
