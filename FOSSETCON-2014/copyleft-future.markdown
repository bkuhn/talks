# Talking Politics and Faith

+ My mother told me:
     + never discuss religion or politics in polite company.
     + but I was quite a rebellious kid.

+ Fact is, anything worthwhile is mired in politics.
     + because reasonable, rational actors simply disagree on politics.

+ Open Source and Free Software is a trecherous political system.
     + &hellip; not often noticed because nearly all our politics are played by proxy.  

# A Recitation of Faith

+ I believe everyone should have the right to copy, share, modify and redistribute all software.
      + i.e., I believe in universal software freedom.

+ I believe that a license can and should be used to defend software freedom (to the maximum extent allowed by law).
      + i.e., I believe in strong copyleft.

+ I believe each developer has the right to decide what Free Software license they choose.

+ These are moral beliefs, admittedly not facts of truth.
      + but the societal permission to make software proprietary is a moral belief on the other side.

# Should Copyleft Exist?

+ I'm not objecting to the debate: Should we have copyleft?

+ But I'm somewhat sick of defending the idea of copyleft.

# The Truce We Once Had

<img src="mundie-behlendorf.jpg" align="right"  />

+ OSCON 2001.

+ Microsoft &ldquo;Shared Source&rdquo; anti-copyleft campaign.

+ Brian Behlendorf of Apache Software Foundation stood up for copyleft.

+ Would ASF do that today?


# Back When It Was a Cause &hellip;

+ In high school, I got beat up for being in the environmental club.

+ We put old carboard boxes in the classrooms, and collected them every Friday.

+ I doubt there are many schools that don't recycle their paper now.
      + on the surface, that's progress.

# The Politics of Cooption

+ I just moved out of a cow-orking facility, called Green Desk.
       + marketing: cow-orking that's good for the environment.

+ They didn't even recycle the paper there: just bins to pretend.

+ It's not the first office I've worked in like this.

+ Usually, I'm the only one who cares.
        + most say: eh, &ldquo;what are you going to do?&rdquo;

# The Politics of Cooption

+ Once an idea becomes accepted as the &ldquo;right thing to do&rdquo;
      + &hellip; lip service works better than getting it right.

+ Take the exploitable parts and leaving the rest.
      + Ultimately, this is what Open Source is.   

# Non-Copyleft Is Easier

+ If your priority is revenue, proprietary software is a better option.
      + or, at least, keep your options open: it's just good business.

+ Usual Open Source arguments still apply:
      + upstream code when it behooves you &hellip;
      + &hellip; don't when it doesn't.

# OSCON, 12 years later

<img src="preston-werner.jpg" align="right"  />

+ Tom Preston-Werner
     + yes, the &ldquo;open source almost everything guy&rdquo;

+ Claims at OSCON 2013:
     * &ldquo;The GPL is a license of restrictions; I don't like restrictions. just
       use MIT&rdquo; [sic]

+ This is so transparently self-serving, yet it's widely accepted.

# Divide And Conquer

+ Microsoft wasn't powerful enough to do what a thousand uncoordinated start-ups can.

+ This isn't a conspiracy; it's a sponteneous alignment of independant self-interest.

# Those Who Forget the Past&hellip;

+ Why is GNU/Linux preferred overwhealming for servers over the BSDs?
      + BSDs have great code:
      + a few infrastructure pieces are essential: TCP/IP, ssh

+ Apple sends *just enough* back to BSDs in resources to keep the core they need.
      + adoption vs. software freedom argument, all over again.

+ This will happen with LLVM too.
      + &hellip; but GCC **will** lose a lot of adoption before the pain begins.

# This Game Is Over

+ Free Software played to stalemate with proprietary on the operating system.
      + We got everything from kernel to application API inside the VM servers.
      + They got everything else.

+ Fourtuately, the software got better overall.
      + &hellip; but that's not nearly enough for universal software freedom.

# The Two New Games

+ application delivery to the browser. 

+ the &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; device, including mobile here.

# The Blurry Line of Javascript

+ Instantaneous install of applications that looks like a page hit.

+ The blurring line of source to object code.
      + so subtle that few see it.
      + Of course, RMS saw this way back when he wrote GPLv2: &ldquo;preferred form of the work for making modifications to it&rdquo;.

+ &hellip; but many who do perceive it differently.

# So, raise your hands:

+ How many of you run LibreJS and/or NoScript browser plugins?

+ How many of use Chromium?

# xdm, Solaris and NIS+

+ I once chased a bug from xdm, down through NIS+ to the Solaris kernel

+ Sun told me my company was &ldquo;too small&rquo; to get it fixed.

+ It's one of the experienced that turned me into a Free Software zealot.

+ Who does this happen to anymore?
    + (almost) no one!
    + Why?

# Chasing the Bug Down the Stack

+ Meanwhile: even proprietary software got better.

+ All software got more complex.

+ The layers of proprietarization got thinner.

# Developers who are Children of the Web

+ You never have all the source ...

+ ... but you're often fed a JSON API.

+ Javascript developers don't consider idea they'd have &ldquo;all the source&rdquo; on hand.

+ &amp; they didn't have a copyleft license anyway ...
      + b/c GPL is the ISC license of web applications.

+ These are also people who found the startups that hate copyleft.
      + Their employers don't know they need it.
      + and these employers let you upstream a bit, after all.

# As the Web grows up

+ They'll reinvent the wheel more.
     + Like all of us old Unix hackers did.

+ Once you do that enough, you pine for copyleft.

+ Cooption will hopefully stop working.
     + &hellip; but that may take a generation.

+ But that may take a generation, meanwhile &hellip;

# Reboostrapping

+ Slowly, the cooption leaves the only essential GPL'd program as Linux.

+ Copyleft works only when we have code that companies can't live without.
      + And if GPL isn't treated like GPL, it doesn't work either.

+ The cooption pushes from this side too.

# Logically Consistent Copyleft?

<img src="wonderful-life_george-clarence-wisper-at-bar.jpg" align="right"  />

+ **GEORGE:** Look, uh &hellip; I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
+ **CLARENCE:** Why? Don't they believe in angels?
+ **GEORGE** I&hellip; yeah, they believe in them&hellip;
+ **CLARENCE:** Ohhh &hellip; Why should they be surprised when they see one?

# Logically Consistent Copyleft?

+ It's fundamentally hypocrisy to say you support copyleft but oppose GPL enforcement.  
     + Yet, this is the **most common position by for-profit companies**.

# If It's Just a Symbol

+ If GPL is just merely a symbol with no real authority.
     + why bother?
     + We might as well all be using the Apache license.  

+ An unenforced copyleft is the functional equivalent to a permissive license.

> Well, if it’s a symbol, to hell with it.

# Enforcement, then start hacking

+ We'll have to reestablished the copyleft of Linux and its value.
      + Enforcement is the only way to do it.

+ We'll need to **code**, ***code**, **code** useful copylefted stuff.

+ Old school copyleft hackers: go learn Node.js.
      + or whatever the kids are into.
      + code on your own time.
      + And tell your employer you want to keep your copyrights, &
      + copyleft your stuff: with Affero GPL.
