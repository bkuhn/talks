 <h2 class="top-title">Why Talk About Copyleft?</h2>
 <p class="fragment">So&hellip;<span class="fragment">Conservancy has many
  activities&hellip;</span><span class="fragment">very few of which are
       licensing work&hellip;</span></p>
 <p class="fragment">&hellip;but people love hearing about copyleft most of all.</p>     
 <p class="fragment">&hellip;&amp; this is the talk Jono wanted.  â˜º</p>     
</section>

<section>
 <h1 class="top-title">What Is Copyleft?</h1>

<q class="copious">Copyleft is a strategy of utilizing copyright law to
pursue the policy goal of fostering &amp; encouraging the equal &amp;
inalienable right to copy, share, modify &amp; improve creative works of
authorship. Copyleft &hellip; describes any method that utilizes the
copyright system to achieve the aforementioned goal. Copyleft as a concept is
usually implemented in the details of a specific copyright license &hellip;
Copyright holders of creative work can unilaterally implement these licenses
for their own works to build communities that collaboratively share &amp;
improve those copylefted creative works.
  
<p align=right> &mdash; Definition of copyleft from
<a href="https://copyleft.org">copyleft.org</a> </q>
</section>

<section >
 <h1 class="top-title">Why Is Copyleft Complicated?</h1>

   <span class="fragment">Copyleft licenses are admittedly longer&hellip; </span>
 <p class="fragment">&hellip; and more complicated.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Because they have a job to do.</p>
</section>

<section>
 <h1 class="top-title">In the Early Days</h1>

 <p>In the early days, companies avoided copyleft and rewrote such software
 from scratch.</p>
  </section>

<section >
 <h3 class="top-title">The Glib Answer</h3>

 <p class="fragment">When I first got involved with copyleft in 1997, when
   asked about how to comply with copyleft licenses, I gave a glib
   answer:</p>
 <p class="fragment">If you can't figure out how to comply, don't use
 copylefted software; write your own instead.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Adoption vs. Software Freedom</h3>
  <p>Copyleft is always a trade-off between adoption and software
    freedom.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 class="top-title">Education about Copyleft's Value</h3>
   <p class="fragment">If we want copyleft adopted, education about it is essential.</p>
   <p class="fragment">So, I started teaching courses on copyleft in 2002.</p>
</section>

<section >
 <h1 class="top-title">The Compliance Industrial Complex</h1>

 <p class="fragment">Between GCC, Linux, Glibc, Bash and a few other
   packages&hellip;</p>

 <p class="fragment">&hellip; it became obvious that companies would seek to
   adopt copylefted software&hellip;</p>
 <p class="fragment">&hellip; and the charities like Conservancy &amp; FSF
 that understood copyleft would not necessarily be the only places to offer
 educational resources.</p>
</section>

<section>
 <h1 class="top-title">The Compliance Industrial Complex</h1>
 <p>In 2004, Black Duck attempted to hire me away from my (then) employer,
   FSF.</p>
</section>

<section>
 <h1 class="top-title">The Compliance Industrial Complex</h1>

 <p>Black Duck offered me the position of &ldquo;Director of Marketing&rdquo;.</p>
</section>

<section >
 <h1 class="top-title">The Compliance Industrial Complex</h1>

 <p class="fragment">It was then I realized that I personally would be used, whether willingly
 or not, as a boogeyman to fear monger among confused copyleft adopters.</p>

 <p class="fragment">I got into software to make people's lives better, not
 to make them afraid of incorporating software.</p>
</section>

<section >
 <h1 class="top-title">The Compliance Industrial Complex</h1>

 <p class="fragment">Dozens of entities now exist that provide proprietary tutorial material
 and software assistance with Open Source and Free Software license compliance.</p>
 <p class="fragment">Black Duck remains the most prominent, but even Linux
 Foundation offers proprietary courses and materials in compliance.</p>
 <p class="fragment">Many use so-called &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; models that
 offer some basic information freely, but the &ldquo;good stuff&rdquo;
   is proprietary and is licensing is expensive.</p>
</section>

<section>
 <h1 class="top-title">Irony of Proprietary Compliance Education</h1>

 <p class="fragment">So, the software is Free as in Freedom&hellip;</p>
 <p class="fragment">&hellip; but to learn how to incorporate it into your
 company, you'll license proprietary software and take proprietary,
   NDA-covered training courses?</p>
</section>

  <h1 class="top-title">University of Phoenix</h1>
    <img align="right" class="fragment" src="img/huff-post-for-profit-schools.png"/>
</section>
<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">University of Phoenix</h1>
  <p class="fragment">University of Phoenix is a for-profit
    &ldquo;university&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
  <p class="fragment">&hellip;it's only one step away from being Trump University&hellip;</p>
  <p class="fragment">&hellip;courses are proprietary; they trick students
  into taking loans to attend.</p>
</section>

<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">U. of Phoenix vs. MIT</h1>
    <img align="right" class="fragment" src="img/mit-courseware-page.png"/>
</section>
<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">MIT</h1>
  <p class="fragment">MIT is admittedly expensive, but it's also a 501(c)(3)
    charity.  They've freely licensed nearly all of their course
    material.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h1 class="top-title">Is This In Spirit of Community?</h1>
  <p class="fragment">FLOSS is filled with barriers to entry.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Those who do not freely license their training
    materials inherently <strong>increase</strong> barriers to entry &amp;
    adoption.</p>
  <p class="fragment">It's frankly scandalous that proprietary FLOSS license
  compliance training materials exist at all.</p>
</section>

<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">The Copyleft Guide</h1>

  <p>125 pages, and growing, of the best content available on how to comply
    with copyleft licenses including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">explanations of political motivations for
      copyleft.</li>
    <li class="fragment">rationale texts from license drafters.</li>
    <li class="fragment">commentary from key copyleft theorists and enforcers.</li>
    <li class="fragment">the only source for detailed case studies of real
      compliance scenarios.</li>
    <li class="fragment">evolves transparently &amp; accepts criticism and improvement.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1 class="top-title">Copyleft.org: The Universal Recipient</h1>

  <p>Copyleft.org seeks to consolidate <strong>all</strong> freely licensed
  materials that teach about copyleft into one place.</p>
</section>

<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Why I Must Write This Guide</h1>

  <p class="fragment">I'm a trained computer scientist and software developer&hellip;</p>
  <p class="fragment">&hellip;but my skills there are more or less average &hellip; </p>
  <p class="fragment">&hellip;and my licensing knowledge is now at expert level &hellip; </p>
  <p class="fragment">&hellip;I believe anyone with knowledge has a moral
  obligation to share that knowledge freely with others.</p>
</section>

<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Why This Must Be A Collaboration</h1>

  <p class="fragment">All parties are biased about everything.</p>
  <p class="fragment">The only way to find truth is study all sides of an issue. </p>
  <p class="fragment">Any guide about a complex political reality that seeks
  to be neutral will fail.</p>
  <p class="fragment">Architect the community to welcome input, however it arrives.</p>
</section>

<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Incorporating Secret Criticism</h1>
  <p class="fragment">We've literally gotten feedback by rumor.</p>
  <p class="fragment">We were leaked a specific criticism regarding a
  specific section of the Guide from an industry lawyer conference call (to
  which we weren't invited).</p>
  <p class="fragment">We updated the Guide based on the feedback and emailed
  the criticizing lawyer.</p>
  <p class="fragment">We hope that you'll be more willing to give us direct
  feedback, of course.</p>
</section>

<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Incorporating Third Party Materials</h1>
  <p class="fragment">Some education projects purport they'll release materials for &ldquo;everyone&rdquo;. </p>
  <p class="fragment">Yet no project exists that is releasing everything;
  it's all subsets or &ldquo;front-matter&rdquo; to sell the &ldquo;real stuff&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="fragment">We nevertheless plan to incorporate anything  released freely so
  copyleft.org is truly comprehensive.</p>
</section>

<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Challenges of Collaboration on Tutorials</h1>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Software development communities knows well how to collaborate on
      software:</li>
    <li class="fragment">tools are (generally) standardized, and all experts have
      willingness to use them.</li>
    <li class="fragment">How do we inspire contribution from experts whose
      primary experience is in Microsoft Word?</li>
    <li class="fragment">We bikeshed LaTeX vs. Markdown, but is that even
    likely to change things.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1 class="top-title">In Other Words</h1>

  <p>Is it even worth switching formats if most experts have other (non-free)
  agendas?</p>
</section>

<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Experts Favoring Proprietary Models</h1>

  <p>Nearly every expert in the field of copyleft compliance who doesn't work
  for FSF or Conservancy has a for-profit business selling their
  expertise.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Of course the Copyleft Guide incorporated the
  &ldquo;freemium releases&rdquo;.</p>
</section>

<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Experts Favoring Proprietary Models</h1>
  <p class="fragment">But we'll have to forever compete with those who wish
  to want to get rich from building pay-walls to access knowledge.</p>
  
  <p class="fragment">The irony is enough to make one wonder if people are
  really serious about what they claim of support for &ldquo;Open
    Source&rdquo;.</p>

  <p class="fragment">Our only option: develop copylefted material that's
  good, promote it, and encourage community around its development. </p>
</section>

<section >
  <h1 class="top-title">A Few Future Plans</h1>

  <p>Here are a few of the plans we have for Copyleft.org:</p>
</section>
  <section>
  <h1 class="top-title">Action Item 1</h1>
    Each major section will have a
    &ldquo;Commentary&rdquo; section, which is designed to include opinions
    on unsettled issues. (The main body of the section will seek to include
  only undisputed conclusions.)
  </section>
  <section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Action Item 2</h1>
<p>Switch to Markdown, in hopes for more
    contribution.</p>
  </section>
  <section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Action Item 3</h1>
    <p> case studies.</p>
  </section>
  <section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Action Item 4</h1>
    <p>Continue advocacy to <a href="">ask the many
        entities releasing proprietary materials to liberate them</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section >
  <h1 class="top-title">Action Item 5</h1>
    <p>Actively listen to your ideas here in the room today.</p>
