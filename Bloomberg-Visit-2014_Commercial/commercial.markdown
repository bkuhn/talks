# Who Am I?

+ President and Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ A 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charity dedicated to promoting, advancing, defending, and developing Free, Libre and Open Source Software.

+ I'm not an analyst, historian, nor a researcher.

+ I do software freedom politics, advocacy and non-profit management.

+ My comments are from that perspective.


# What Is This Stuff?

+ You've probably heard about Open Source.

+ Software freedom is the more political way to talk about it.
     + Think in terms of: what rights and freedoms you get with the software?

+ This is a philosophical moral position that's developed over decades.

+ It's not incompatible with capitalism
     + (in fact, it fits right in there).
     + More on that later.

# Ye Ol' Four Freedoms

+ to use.

+ to learn and modify for yourself.

+ to copy and share.

+ to modify and share modified versions.

# Philosophical Underpinnings

+ 1984-09-27: GNU Manifesto.

+ Richard M. Stallman (RMS) wrote in that *GNU Manifesto*:
      - *"All sorts of development can be funded with a Software Tax"*
      - *"People with new ideas could distribute programs as [free software], asking for donations from satisfied users"*

+ Purely non-profit fundraising style was initial funding ideas.

# Initial Development

+ Most early Free Software was written by academics (or those affiliated with
  academic institutions).

+ Minimal initial commercial interest.

+ Meanwhile &hellip;

# Rebutted Complaints

+ Obviously, people said RMS was a communist.
      - sharing all your software does have a certain hippie spirit to it.

+ RMS begins to add a Rebutted Objections section:
      - beginnings of the business models debate.

# Justify Your Existence

+ Most social justice causes have to make their case to corporate business.

+ Consider environmentalism:
      + &ldquo;if I recycle, and my competitor doesn't, I'm at a disadvantage.&rdquo;
      + So, how do we get to recycling bins everywhere?

+ Open, oft-debated question: is this kowtowing or good advocacy strategy?

# The Classic Business Model

+ Early idealists centered around two specific business models:
      + Sell support contracts.
      + Sell custom modifications.

+ These showed early success.

# The Cygnus Era

+ The smartest move Red Hat ever made was acquiring Cygnus with its IPO
  capital.

+ Cygnus built the first successful software freedom business.

+ How and why did this happen?


# The First Essential Codebase

+ GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) was the first Free Software program no one
  could live without.

+ It replaced a fragmented proprietary market with weak products:
       + with a single well designed product.
       + under a copyleft license (more on that later).

+ Cygnus' founders realized this early enough to act.

+ Rather than first to market, it's more &ldquo;first to talent&rdquo;.

+ Does this work in a crowded market?:
       + I have no idea, I'm a non-profit guy, remember? :)

# Why GCC Needed Commerce

+ Chipset manufacturers needed compilers for their new architectures quickly.

+ Free Software projects always move slow.

+ Not easy to sign a deadline-centered deal with a non-profit.

+ Infrastructure and motivations of a commercial actor is essential.

# What Stopped Proprietarization?

+ The real innovation isn't the philosophical realization of four freedoms.

+ Copyleft guarantees a truly free market.

+ Proprietarized Free Software can create new monopolies.
