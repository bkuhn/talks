# Who Am I?

+ President and Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ A 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charity dedicated to promoting, advancing, defending, and developing Free, Libre and Open Source Software.

+ I'm not an analyst, historian, nor a researcher.

+ I do software freedom politics, advocacy and non-profit management.

+ My comments are from that perspective.
