# Who Am I?

+ President and Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ A 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charity dedicated to promoting, advancing, defending, and developing Free, Libre and Open Source Software.

+ I'm not an analyst, historian, nor a researcher.

+ I do software freedom politics, advocacy and non-profit management.

+ My comments are from that perspective.


# What Is This Stuff?

+ You've probably heard about Open Source.

+ Software freedom is the more political way to talk about it.
     + Think in terms of: what rights and freedoms you get with the software?

+ This is a philosophical moral position that's developed over decades.

+ It's not incompatible with capitalism
     + (in fact, it fits right in there).
     + More on that later.

# Ye Ol' Four Freedoms

+ to use.

+ to learn and modify for yourself.

+ to copy and share.

+ to modify and share modified versions.
