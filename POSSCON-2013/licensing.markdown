# Who Am I?

+ President and Executive Director of Software Freedom Conservancy.

+ A 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charity dedicated to promoting, advancing, defending, and developing Free, Libre and Open Source Software.

+ I used to be software developer.

+ I was Executive Director (2001-2005) of the Free Software Foundation (creater of GPL)
     + I'm still on FSF's Board of Directors as a volunteer. 

# Ye Ol' Four Freedoms

+ to use.

+ to learn and modify for yourself.

+ to copy and share.

+ to modify and share modified versions.

# Why Do We Need Licenses?

+ None of those freedoms happen by default.

+ Software is governed by copyright &hellip;
       + &hellip; since it's expression fixed in a tangible medium.

+ only way to give those freedoms is to give a license.

# What Free Software License Does?

+ Copyright on software governs three basic activities:
         + copying, modifying and distributing.

+ By default, you're prohibited from doing those things.

+ A license is:
      + a document that gives you permissions &hellip;
      + &hellip; that you otherwise wouldn't have.

+ Free software license, first and foremost:
      + assert recipient's to copy, share, modify and redistribute the software.

# Does/Should a License Do More?

+ Ultimately depends on the authors' goal.
      + More on this in a moment.

+ Every Free Software license gives first receipient those four freedoms.

+ Question is: What about everyone else?

# Basics of Copyleft Licensing

+ Concept: share and share alike.

+ Accomplished via copyright requirements:
      + distribution accompanied with complete, corresponding source.
      + distribution of modified versions need same (with changes).

+ Generally triggered on distribution:
      + (Note: Affero GPL triggers on modification.
